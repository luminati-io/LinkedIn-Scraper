      "Andrew Tarvin ‚ÄúJustin is fantastic. Between his high quality LI posts and the Creator MBA, I've been able to start building out a second part of my business. Seeking clarity, I booked a 15-minute Intro call with Justin. I was skeptical of how much we could really accomplish in only 15 minutes, but he started dropping knowledge from the start. He gave me a crystal clear plan of action in the first 8 minutes and we even had time to go to a secondary question I had. Regardless of how you interact with him, Justin will always be a positive ROI.‚Äù",
      "John Kraski ‚ÄúI‚Äôm beyond excited to write this recommendation for Justin Welsh. I spent my entire life struggling to build my personal brand and never could figure it out until I found Justin‚Äôs work about 5 years ago. Since that time, I‚Äôve purchased all of his courses and also done consulting with him. There‚Äôs a lot of people out there telling you how to build your brand on LinkedIn and monetize it but there is only one person that truly delivers results and that is Justin Welsh. The pricing for his products and services are so well priced that everyone that wants to amplify their social media presence can afford them. I highly encourage anyone and everyone looking to level-up their LinkedIn and Twitter games in 2024 and beyond to follow Justin and purchase his courses. The ROI for me has easily been 100x. Trust me this will be the best investment you will ever make in yourself. You‚Äôll thank me later.‚Äù"
