The app is based on a web interface used to create Toolkits which are shown in the app‚Äôs Toolkits store. The interface control which sources to use, what info to extract from each source, how often to track for new/edited data. The platform supports many types of data sources : websites, web services, APIs and more. The interface has 2 types of trackers: regular and paramed trackers. The regular trackers are used to track pre defined urls, while the paramed trackers give the users the ability to create their own trackers when entering pre defined query parameters in the Toolkit. The interface also allows the creator to define the category which the Toolkit belongs to, and then can choose to either distribute the Toolkit in the app Toolkit‚Äôs store or send it to his friends by setting it as a private Toolkit and find it in the store with a personal code. The app is targeted for both B2C and B2B clients. B2C clients can enjoy the variety of Toolkits and help them to find new content like news, stock prices, tickets to events, job opportunities, cars, houses and more and do more complicated tasks like set up a price target for a product they interested in and get notification in case the price is adjusted, check for hotel availability and much more. B2B clients can also enjoy the abilities of the platform and use it to follow and analyze their competitor‚Äôs price changes, stocks, reviews, ranking, HR recruiting, advertising strategies and more.",
