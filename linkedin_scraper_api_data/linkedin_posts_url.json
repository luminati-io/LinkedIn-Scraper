    "post_text": "TL;DR: Sunbursts make people look smart on a slide, but it’s much harder when it comes to actually making it actionable. Additional modeling on top of journey visualization can be done to find great insights What is a sunburst? First things first, let’s clarify the topic: although a beautiful sunset probably has more value than this whole article, this is NOT what we’re about to talk of here. Yep, sorry, this page is about data analytics. From Wikipedia “A ring chart, also known as a sunburst chart or a multilevel pie chart, is used to visualize hierarchical data, depicted by concentric circles” In the digital analytics world and especially in CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization) it’s used for describing user behavior , especially on a website to understand how people navigate from one page to another. First central ring is basically a pie chart of your landing pages, then the second ring is where people go after the first page etc… until they ultimately leave your website, with or without buying (and that is the question). Note the usage of this type of chart can be used outside of web product optimization. For instance, you can definitely imagine the same approach for describing how people ultimately land on your site, through different acquisition channels, where touch points would not be web pages anymore but rather a category of acquisition channels. Sunbursts appear to be trendy in the CRO eco-system because it’s relatively new, it’s easy to understand, and it’s somehow good looking . At least much more than the ugly “behavior flow” of google analytics, although it’s saying the same thing The ugly and old “behavior flow” of Google analytics A classic sunburst You should read the highlighted as 0.3% of visitors have seen a product page then temporarily left the site and then came back in another session on a product page, ... etc, until they finally left out from the website on a product page. How do you get it? There are many ways you can get a sunburst describing your user journey, and everything depends on how you collect the data. Some tools like Content Square give it right in their platform, but it comes with a significant cost (often 100s of k€). The below aims at giving you the keys to do it for much cheaper, with the web analytics tracking tool that you’re already using (and likely paying for). For what it's worth, typical fees at DataMa for those types of assignments are below 10k€, and it comes with actionable insights. We’ll give you a glance on how to get it from Google Analytics because it represents >80% of the web analytics market. However, it’s also possible on other tools like Adobe or AT Internet. All you need is access to the sessionid in order to be able to track journey consistently. Google analytics Google 360 customers with Big Query Stangely, I’ve always found few people mastering Big Query requests to extract what they could not extract from Google Analytics interface. This is probably because Web analytics is a complicated area for general data analysts, SQL is (wrongly) not a prerequisite for being a web analyst in most companies and nested tables are frightening at the start. Yet, it’s amazing how many things you can do when you start playing with Big Query on top of Google Analytics tables. Anyhow, the idea is to write a query that ends up with a result that looks a bit like the screenshot below, with a “Journey” column that contains the pages that the user has seen in chronological orde r (something like “Page 1 - Page 2 - Page 3”), and the number of users who did this. I won’t spend time here on the technical aspects to get it, but you just need to know that the GA BQ export schema is your reference, STRING_AGG is the function you’re looking for and that you need to be careful about what you account and what you don’t account, because you can easily mess up with hits definitions. How the results of your query should look like in Big Query Google analytics free customers Side note for people who are not Google 360 and don’t have access to Big Query: you can still make i t, although it might be a bit less detailed. Google gives you access to the landing page path, the exit page path, the previous page path and the current page path. That’s quite enough to get at least a 5 floors sunburst, as long as you don’t bother getting into some hard thinking and have a language to tap into the GA reporting API to avoid sampling (and if you don’t, I can certainly drive you to the excellent GoogleanalyticsR package by Mark Edmonson that does an awesome job in it) A screenshot from the Dimensions & Metrics explorer for GA . The last 4 are the one you’re looking for! Visualize it Having the dataset is the hard part. Visualizing the chart itself is much easier . There are many ways you could visualize the data you’ve built as a sunburst. Most of them use D3 JS technology under the wood. The funny part is that a former Google employee is actually publishing the original article behind this (see here ) but I’ve never seen it in Google Analytics, nor in Data Studio. If you’re familiar with Plotly (either in R or Python), they have a great template that you can use easily with your favorite language. At DataMa we’re instead using the R SunburstR package from Kent Russel that does a great job in displaying the sequential journeys. Sunburst function in sunburstR package in R Note that you can also integrate that R/ Python/ JS generated chart into your favorite reporting tool, such as Tableau, Power BI or Data Studio. There are also some ways to create native sunburst in Tableau (see this incredible hack here - take your time, and avoid having more than 1000 lines given the number of nested calculations inside!) or this extension in Power BI How do you get value out of it? Well, that’s actually the only good question. Because if sunbursts look good, they are actually hard to read, hard to compare, and hard to make actionable . So you probably want to go in a bit more modeling before actually using it in real life. Below are two use cases that we are extensively using at DataMa. Use case 1: Understanding customer behaviors - aka similarity index We developed that use case right after the lock down for Covid 19 in 2020. Traditional website KPIs were really low. In particular, clients in the travel industry were badly hit in terms of traffic and conversion. So, after some few weeks of fire fighting crisis mode, the question from our clients was: how to know when my customers start to behave “normally” on my website so that I can start reinvesting on my acquisition campaigns? One could say that you can just look at conversion (transactions/ sessions) and this is a good indicator of whether or not people come back to your website in order to purchase, or still to get informed about how to deal with Covid impacts. But it may not be entirely sufficient. Two main reasons: Conversion is based on transactions, that were really low at this time, so the signal is quite volatile and an increase or decrease could not be statistically significant There is some delay (typically one or two weeks) between the first time a user visits a website and the moment he converts, in particular in the travel industry. So you may have a lag between the moment people start to behave normally and the moment you see conversion going back up. Another option would be just to look at the volume of traffic, but if you use that to trigger your acquisition investments, then it’s a self fulfilling prophecy… no investment -> no traffic, and no traffic -> no investment… So we end up saying: “why not sizing how much user journeys are similar between two periods?” . The idea is basically to compare the volumes on each journey (each “radius” of the sunburst) between one period and another to end up with an index between 0 and 100% . 100% would mean that you have exactly the same split of traffic, and 0% would mean that you have no comparable journeys. The concept of similarity index Cool thing is that you can monitor that index over time (each week vs. the same week last year, to net the effect of seasonality) and use it to inform your decision to open investments at the right time before competition. Experience has shown that the index has a more stable evolution over time than conversion, and that it was helpful to understand when people started to behave normally. An example of similarity index in Tableau During the COVID, we observed a significant difference in customer journey (type and order of web pages viewed by our web visitors) with the help of Datama Solution. The similarity index is strongly correlated to the evolution of the crisis : shock, denial, doubt, accept, adapt. Fanjuan Shi, Analytics & Data Science director at Pierre et Vacances Center Parcs Use case 2: Value attribution - aka DataMa Journey Another interesting use case to get value out of a Sunburst is to create a value attribution model to allocate value to each page of your website based on how Journey converts. For instance if you have a converting Journey “Home - Search - Product - Purchase ” that brings you 100€, you can use a constant attribution model to allocate 25€ to each page. Hence your Homepage worths 25€, your Search 25€, your Product page 25€ and your purchase page 25€. After this, you can now use that attribution to allocate “lost value” to non converting journeys. For instance continuing the same example above, if you have a “Search-Product” journey that doesn't convert, you could say that it lost a potential value of 50€ (25+25) due to the product page (which is the exit page). So the Product page is then responsible for bringing 25€ value but also for losing -50€ virtual value. Doing this allocation and dealing with volumes can get a little bit tricky, so we’ve built an automated tool called DataMa Journey that helps you doing that (you can test it here ) An exciting usage of this approach in CRO is to prioritize your roadmap of AB tests between pages based on where you get value and where you lose it. This has proven to be tremendously helpful to back up help product teams being data driven, on top of other insights from customer feedback, or competition watching. We recently did a webinar on this that I encourage you to watch here ! Example of AB test prioritization matrix in DataMa Journey",

All you need is access to the sessionid in order to be able to track journey consistently.</p><h2>Google analytics</h2><h3>Google 360 customers with Big Query</h3><p>Stangely, I&#x2019;ve always found few people mastering Big Query requests to extract what they could not extract from Google Analytics interface. This is probably because Web analytics is a complicated area for general data analysts, SQL is (wrongly) not a prerequisite for being a web analyst in most companies and nested tables are frightening at the start. Yet, it&#x2019;s amazing how many things you can do when you start playing with Big Query on top of Google Analytics tables.</p><p>Anyhow, the idea is to write a query that ends up with a result that looks a bit like the screenshot below, with <strong>a &#x201C;Journey&#x201D; column that contains the pages that the user has seen in chronological orde</strong>r (something like &#x201C;Page 1 - Page 2 - Page 3&#x201D;), and the number of users who did this.&#xA0;</p><p>I won&#x2019;t spend time here on the technical aspects to get it, but you just need to know that the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3437719?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">GA BQ export schema</a> is your reference, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/functions-and-operators#string_agg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">STRING_AGG</a> is the function you&#x2019;re looking for and that you need to be careful about what you account and what you don&#x2019;t account, because you can easily mess up with hits definitions.</p><div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"><img alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D12AQGBgyd3K03p2g/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1589189835205?e=1740009600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=iuoI9945IuxQ-gplexm_NJrVbWNImmYcUE6o6KPjLVU\" src=\"//:0\"></div><p><em>How the results of your query should look like in Big Query</em></p><h3>Google analytics free customers</h3><p>Side note for people who are not Google 360 and <strong>don&#x2019;t have access to Big Query: you can still make i</strong>t, although it might be a bit less detailed. Google gives you access to the landing page path, the exit page path, the previous page path and the current page path. That&#x2019;s quite enough to get at least a 5 floors sunburst, as long as you don&#x2019;t bother getting into some hard thinking and have a language to tap into the GA reporting API to avoid sampling (and if you don&#x2019;t, I can certainly drive you to the excellent <a href=\"https://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">GoogleanalyticsR</a> package by Mark Edmonson that does an awesome job in it)</p><p>&#xA0;</p><div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"><img alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D12AQHicqqXWIfaVw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1589189853079?e=1740009600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=h0h7nHeHEHbWjYagTz2Yu4o5gZtJ6jjekOvNL6UxWIg\" src=\"//:0\"></div><p><em>A screenshot from the </em><a href=\"https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/dimensions-metrics-explorer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><em>Dimensions &amp; Metrics explorer for GA</em></a><em>.

There are many ways you could visualize the data you&#x2019;ve built as a sunburst. Most of them use D3 JS technology under the wood. The funny part is that a former Google employee is actually publishing the original article behind this (see <a href=\"https://bl.ocks.org/kerryrodden/7090426\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here</a>) but I&#x2019;ve never seen it in Google Analytics, nor in Data Studio.&#xA0;</p><p>If you&#x2019;re familiar with Plotly (either in R or Python), they have a great <a href=\"https://plotly.com/python/sunburst-charts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">template</a> that you can use easily with your favorite language.&#xA0;<strong>At DataMa we&#x2019;re instead using the R </strong><a href=\"https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/sunburstR/versions/2.1.3/topics/sunburst\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">SunburstR</a><strong> package </strong>from Kent Russel that does a great job in displaying the sequential journeys.</p><div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"><img alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D12AQFAZPm_ul1wMw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1589189891140?e=1740009600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=d6HakychaMu-tUTsYIK7becb8Qlgh7ij5X_2lH8-E2U\" src=\"//:0\"></div><p><em>Sunburst function in sunburstR package in R</em></p><p>Note that you can also integrate that R/ Python/ JS generated chart into your favorite reporting tool, such as Tableau, Power BI or Data Studio.&#xA0;</p><p>There are also some ways to create native sunburst in Tableau (see this incredible hack <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEf-k5iPAW8\" target=\"_blank\">here </a>- take your time, and avoid having more than 1000 lines given the number of nested calculations inside!) or this extension in <a href=\"https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi-visuals/WA104380767?tab=Overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Power BI</a></p><h2>How do you get value out of it?</h2><p>Well, that&#x2019;s actually the only good question. Because if sunbursts look good, they are actually <strong>hard to read, hard to compare, and hard to make actionable</strong>. So you probably want to go in a bit more modeling before actually using it in real life. Below are two use cases that we are extensively using at DataMa.&#xA0;</p><h2>Use case 1: Understanding customer behaviors - aka similarity index</h2><p>We developed that use case right after the lock down for Covid 19 in 2020. Traditional website KPIs were really low. In particular, clients in the travel industry were badly hit in terms of traffic and conversion. So, after some few weeks of fire fighting crisis mode, the question from our clients was: <strong>how to know when my customers start to behave &#x201C;normally&#x201D; on my website so that I can start reinvesting on my acquisition campaigns?&#xA0;</strong></p><p>One could say that you can just look at conversion (transactions/ sessions) and this is a good indicator of whether or not people come back to your website in order to purchase, or still to get informed about how to deal with Covid impacts. But it may not be entirely sufficient. Two main reasons:&#xA0;</p><ul><li>Conversion is based on transactions, that were really low at this time, so the signal is quite volatile and an increase or decrease could not be statistically significant</li><li>There is some delay (typically one or two weeks) between the first time a user visits a website and the moment he converts, in particular in the travel industry. So you may have a lag between the moment people start to behave normally and the moment you see conversion going back up.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Another option would be just to look at the volume of traffic, but if you use that to trigger your acquisition investments, then it&#x2019;s a self fulfilling prophecy&#x2026; no investment -&gt; no traffic, and no traffic -&gt; no investment&#x2026;</p><p>So we end up saying: &#x201C;why not sizing how much user journeys are similar between two periods?&#x201D; . The idea is basically to <strong>compare the volumes on each journey</strong> (each &#x201C;radius&#x201D; of the sunburst) between one period and another to end up with an<strong> index between 0 and 100%</strong>. 100% would mean that you have exactly the same split of traffic, and 0% would mean that you have no comparable journeys.</p><div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"><img alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D12AQFfHoRIohdRBA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1589189947489?e=1740009600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=iCIhZe-3olRlYnbgQFE1j0BxDPZSO0RalydoUc2Hibw\" src=\"//:0\"></div><p><em>The concept of similarity index</em></p><p>Cool thing is that you can <strong>monitor that index over time</strong> (each week vs. the same week last year, to net the effect of seasonality) and use it to inform your decision to open investments at the right time before competition. Experience has shown that the index has a more stable evolution over time than conversion, and that it was helpful to understand when people started to behave normally.&#xA0;</p><div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"><img alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D12AQEoe_EFMQDNIg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1589190025701?e=1740009600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=ljYthRkBCgbPB0Qy2X6Og4SMjbGXT8skLPOzTJZVK10\" src=\"//:0\"></div><p><em>An example of similarity index in Tableau</em></p><p><br></p><blockquote><em>During the COVID, we observed a significant difference in customer journey (type and order of web pages viewed by our web visitors) with the help of Datama Solution.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>The similarity index is strongly correlated to the evolution of the crisis : shock, denial, doubt, accept, adapt.&#xA0;</em></blockquote><p>Fanjuan Shi, Analytics &amp; Data Science director at Pierre et Vacances Center Parcs</p><h2>Use case 2: Value attribution - aka DataMa Journey</h2><p>Another interesting use case to get value out of a Sunburst is to create a value attribution model to allocate value to each page of your website based on how Journey converts.&#xA0;</p><p>For instance if you have a converting Journey &#x201C;Home - Search - Product - Purchase &#x201D; that brings you 100&#x20AC;, you can use a constant attribution model to allocate 25&#x20AC; to each page. Hence your Homepage worths 25&#x20AC;, your Search 25&#x20AC;, your Product page 25&#x20AC; and your purchase page 25&#x20AC;.&#xA0;</p><p>After this, you can now use that attribution to allocate &#x201C;lost value&#x201D; to non converting journeys. For instance continuing the same example above, if you have a &#x201C;Search-Product&#x201D; journey that doesn&apos;t convert, you could say that it lost a potential value of 50&#x20AC; (25+25) due to the product page (which is the exit page). So the Product page is then responsible for bringing 25&#x20AC; value but also for losing -50&#x20AC; virtual value.&#xA0;</p><p>Doing this allocation and dealing with volumes can get a little bit tricky, so <strong>we&#x2019;ve built an automated tool called DataMa Journey that helps you doing that</strong> (you can test it <a href=\"https://solutions.datama.fr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here</a>)</p><p>An exciting usage of this approach in CRO is to prioritize your roadmap of AB tests between pages based on where you get value and where you lose it. This has proven to be tremendously helpful to back up help product teams being data driven, on top of other insights from customer feedback, or competition watching.

    "post_text": "Back-testing methodologies to run more AB tests in less time on a website, in order to increase final conversion uplift in a limited time range. This article is also available on Medium with more reference here 1. Introduction and context Many companies that have something to sell do it through an online platform. It is thus mandatory to have an accessible, easy-to-use, and attractive website to maximise their revenues. One way to achieve that is to continuously improve their e-commerce website using the well-known A/B testing method : change one feature (or a few in the case of multi-testing…) at a time (ranging from the colour of a button to the whole payment procedure), allocate half the traffic to each version and conclude which is the best after a certain amount of customer sessions/time. However, since the expected difference in user behaviour between the two versions is often very small (a click-through-rate of 1.50% on page A vs an expected one of 1.53% on page B for example), the required sample size needed to reach a conclusion with a 95% confidence level is often quite considerable. This can, in turn, lead analytics teams to wait many weeks before deciding if they should implement the new feature and hence waste time and money . With this in mind, a question naturally pops up: How can we optimise this A/B testing method to our advantage ? One answer would be to end the tests earlier than the estimated required sample size. Indeed, it would then be possible to set up more tests and potentially improve our website more quickly. But one has to keep in mind that this sample size is there for a reason : ensure that our test has a certain statistical power given a chosen confidence level and an estimated minimal difference in user behaviour (for example, a test with a power of 80%, a confidence level of 95% and a detectable user difference of 0.03% between a click-through rate of 1.5% on page A vs 1.53% on page B requires 2 602 422 visits on each version of the website). Indeed, stopping a test earlier reduces its power and hence its ability to return the correct rollout. Simply put, a shortened test will be wrong more often. In the end, what we want to know is if the trade-off is in our favour: in time, will the company’s online revenues increase if it decides to set up more shortened tests with less accuracy ? All the research necessary for this article was done with the support of Pierre et Vacances Center Parcs (PVCP), who accompanied us throughout our work and gave us access to some of their real-life A/B tests so that we could put our theoretical results to the test. We’ve made a good talk with Fanjuan Shi , from Pierre et Vacances Center Parcs about this research, with great work of Adrien Salem here at DataMa . You can find the video here 2. Approach and methodology The current statistical methods used by analytics teams are either frequentist or Bayesian with a 95% confidence level (CL). The required sample size is calculated based on an estimated uplift between the two versions of the website, and the decision is only made once it has been reached. This process is applied even if a significant result appears early on, to avoid early fake positive. But doing so prevents us from making early decisions and moving on to other tests, which can be in our interest in some cases that we will have to define. The goal of this article is to challenge these approaches (i.e. methods, confidence levels and stop time). To do so, we have considered 6 methodologies (including the two previous ones) used in the web and pharma industries to make statistically backed decisions as well as different CLs (confidence levels) ranging from 95% down to 50%. We have applied them to both 5 sets of 30 simulated tests and 10 real-life tests run on PVCP websites of varying magnitude (from 5,000 to 500,000 sessions/week). We have chosen to keep the two current approaches in our study and take their efficiency as a baseline to which we can refer when comparing other methods/CLs. From now on, we will stop a test as soon as we reach significance , regardless of the required sample size. As you will have no doubt already guessed, this significance (and the decision that it induces) will change with the different methods and CLs, and we will hence try to come up with the most accurate bundle/package of method + CL to replace the traditional approaches described above. However, to avoid stopping a test with insufficient data and making too many errors, we have decided to always wait for at least 100 conversions on each version and for a whole week of testing, in order to account for the real-life varying traffic throughout the week. Finally, the testing duration is limited to 12 weeks (i.e. 3 months) which is a standard duration in A/B testing. Before we go any further, let me quickly describe the different methods that we will be discussing: 1/ Frequentist : Welsh t test used either once the required sample size is reached or as soon as a significant result appears. 2/ Bayesian : Same as frequentist but with a Bayesian test . 3/ Chi squared : Chi squared independence test is used to see if there is a significant difference between a certain category of 2 variables. In our case, we compare the number of conversions and sessions (categories) on the two versions of the website (variables). This method is rarely used in A/B testing. 4/ LD Bounds : We end the test as soon as the Z-score (same as the frequentist t-score) becomes either drastically too small (below the futility boundary) or too large (above the efficacy boundary). The test eventually terminates since the two boundaries meet at the end. This method widely used in medical trials where making a decision as early as possible is crucial. 5/ Permutation : We combine samples (a bunch of 0s and 1s where a 0 corresponds to a session without conversion and 1 to a conversion) together and randomly pick observations (still the 0s and 1s) without replacement to form new samples. Compute the statistic (ie difference of means=conversion rate in our case) on each permutation to yield a distribution and compare the original statistic to it. We use the p-value to conclude (as in the Welch t test). This method is especially convenient for multi-testing (more than 2 versions of a website). 6/ Bootstrap : Same as the permutation method but with replacement when forming new samples. This is another resampling procedure mainly used to assess the reliability of an estimate. It is now time to put all these methods and CLs to the test ! To do so, we firstly compared the different roll-outs on isolated tests. But to be more precise, we then considered the ideal , assessed and real accumulated uplifts (IAC, AAC and RAC respectively) in conversion rate and then in actual revenues on a set of tests. For each Methodology and Confidence level, we’re able to compare the assessed, ideal and actual uplift resulting from our AB test Let me define those terms : for a given set of tests, the ideal accumulated uplift would be the maximum uplift that a company could get if its teams made all the right decisions, the assessed accumulated uplift is the uplift a certain method thinks we end up with and the real accumulated uplift is the one we really end up with based on the decisions made by a certain method. In addition, we can add a duration factor by considering the time each method took before reaching the end of the set of tests. One way to do that is by calculating yearly ideal, assessed and real accumulated uplifts. These indicators show both the accuracy and the efficiency of the different methods at varying CLs. Keep in mind that all of this is only possible if many A/B tests of good quality are ready to be put in production ! 3. Analysis of the simulations 3.1 Simulated test example Before diving more deeply into the analysis of the simulation, let us first look at one isolated test . This is test number 16 of the 5th set of 30 tests, it has a real uplift of -0.6% and we have chosen a confidence level of 90% (i.e. an alpha = the probability of a type-I error of 0.1). Each arrow corresponds to the decision made after an additional week of data gathering (approximately 260,000 sessions per week in this example) : grey and small means no decision whereas coloured and large means that a decision has been made by a certain method. Finally, the x-axis corresponds to the current number of sessions as weeks go by and the y-axis to the assessed uplifts. We can clearly notice that the roll-outs differ with the method : after only 3 weeks, the permutation method wrongly concludes a positive roll-out; chi squared is still indecisive after 12 weeks; the other methods are all correct but at different times… Obviously, since the real uplift is close to zero , there is a high chance of ending up with the wrong outcomes, all the more so if the decision is made early on. 3.2. Accumulated uplifts for a set of 30 simulated tests Let us now focus on how each method fares on a whole set of 30 simulated tests given a 90% confidence level. The following graph shows the ideal accumulated uplift, which is the same regardless of the method, as well as the real accumulated uplifts as we go through the 30 tests and the assessed accumulated uplifts for each method. While the real accumulated uplift is approximately the same, the time (i.e. number of sessions) taken by each method varies a lot. Furthermore, the assessed accumulated uplift is always higher than the real and ideal ones, especially for the bootstrap and Bayesian methods. This is something to remember: when an analytics team announces a certain estimated uplift, it will most probably be overestimated ! 3.3. Real uplift vs Ideal uplift Before moving on to the final and most conclusive graph, we will look at the impact of the confidence level on the accuracy . Indeed, for now, we have only considered a confidence level of 90%, which seems arbitrary. It seems natural that the accuracy, which is measured as the average of the real over the ideal accumulated uplift , tends to decrease as the confidence level decreases since the decisions are made with less data and hence less precision. However, for very high confidence levels, the accuracy can be lower (chi squared, LD bounds). In these cases, the required sample size is often higher than the number of sessions reached within 12 weeks (maximum duration of a test) : we are thus ending many tests without any decision. Furthermore, the “full_freq” and “full_bayes” methods, which correspond to the current methods used (i.e. a frequentist or Bayesian test once the required sample size is reached and not before), show similar behaviours and do not seem to be affected that much by the choice of the confidence level. The permutation and bootstrap methods, on the other hand, have a better accuracy than the two former ones for high confidence levels. 3.4. Total gain in conversion relative to current methodology Finally, it is time to look at a graph which takes all of this into account : the accuracy and the time taken to make these decisions . The y-axis represents the average gain in conversion compared to the current situation (i.e. the “full_bayes” method with a 95% confidence level). The figures on the curves show the factor of more tests we would need to run if we chose a certain method and confidence level. As expected, decreasing the confidence level radically decreases the duration of the test. Hence, we can simulate the additional uplift that could be taken if we were to run more tests during the saved time. Overall, this widely compensates the loss in accuracy : decreasing the confidence level by 5% allows us to run almost twice as many tests, so theoretically, to double the final uplift, as long as these new tests are just as good . However, in real life, implementing twice as many tests of the same high quality is not that easy. All we are saying here is that, from a statistical point of view, the more tests we have, the lower the confidence level can be and the higher the accumulated uplift becomes. 3.5. Estimation is not reality One last side note before the conclusion of this article the assessed uplifts are not reality . Indeed, as mentioned earlier, the assessed uplifts are always higher than the real uplifts, and this is ever more substantial as the confidence level decreases. Furthermore, while being much longer to run, “full_bayes” methodology is also much more accurate in the assessment of the implemented uplift (the ratio is very close to 1). Regarding all the other methods which stop tests earlier, the assessed uplifts are even less accurate. However, what really matters is the real uplift and not its estimation , so even if a method is not very accurate, it is worth trying out as long as it can allow us to run more tests with a satisfactory real uplift. In a nutshell, keep in mind that while assessed uplifts are always higher than real ones, it is not necessarily a drawback. 4. Recommendations and final conclusion First outcome of our simulation is that the Bootstrap method seems to be the winning method for high confidence level (>85%). Switching from full Bayesian to Bootstrap could give PVCP an uplift of ~2% just by making the right decisions more often. While this method is hard to compute in a simple Excel spreadsheet, we’ve built a tool ( DataMa Impact ) that allows for doing it simply. Second outcome is that surprisingly, based on simulated tests (150 tests), it seems that even at the current level of confidence (95%), waiting for the estimated duration could be avoided without much cost. If we respect the rule of having more than 100 conversions on each version of our website, we could already reduce the duration of tests by ~2 and more than double our real uplift while keeping the same accuracy in roll out decisions if we believe we can implement 2 times more tests of the same quality . Furthermore, decreasing the level of confidence to 85% could allow us to divide the time of run of AB tests by another ~1.9, and, assuming that we could use this saved time to run more AB tests of the same quality, this could end up in another x1.6 increase in the conversion improvement compared to what we have today in a year. Back testing this recommended approach on real-life tests shows that we would have taken the same decision in 10 out of 10 considered tests, while decreasing their cumulative duration by ~50%, which is reassuring. One important note: changing methodology comes with a slight cost in measurement accuracy: the estimated uplift that we report on a yearly basis with current methodology is about +20% higher than the real uplift that we actually get on our site. This could go as high as +85% if we switch the methodology to bootstrap and decrease the confidence level to 90%. It is an important data point to keep in mind while measuring website progress and financial benefits/ ROI of the experimentation team. One last key learning is that the actual uplift that we implement on our websites is about 85% of the one in an ‘ideal world’ where we would always make the right decision. For the last time, all this increase in uplifts can only happen if many AB tests of good quality are ready to go: the limit is not set by statistics theory, but by the efficiency of a company’s AB testing teams !",

One way to achieve that is to continuously improve their e-commerce website using the well-known&#xA0;<strong>A/B testing method</strong>&#xA0;: change one feature (or a few in the case of multi-testing&#x2026;) at a time (ranging from the colour of a button to the whole payment procedure), allocate half the traffic to each version and conclude which is the best after a certain amount of customer sessions/time. However, since the&#xA0;<strong>expected</strong>&#xA0;difference in user behaviour between the two versions is often very small (a click-through-rate of 1.50% on page A vs an expected one of 1.53% on page B for example), the&#xA0;<strong>required sample size</strong>&#xA0;needed to reach a conclusion with a 95% confidence level is often quite considerable. This can, in turn, lead analytics teams to wait many weeks before deciding if they should implement the new feature and hence&#xA0;<strong>waste time and money</strong>.</p><p>With this in mind, a question naturally pops up:&#xA0;<strong>How can we optimise this A/B testing method to our advantage ?</strong></p><div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-left\"><img alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D12AQEwDbpJbHwT1w/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1608193404663?e=1740009600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=0SIKYc0U9ChQu0behnC902EibR2KWuxFnlxTYFRAdMk\" src=\"//:0\"></div><p>One answer would be to&#xA0;<strong>end the tests earlier</strong>&#xA0;than the estimated required sample size. Indeed, it would then be possible to set up more tests and potentially improve our website more quickly. But one has to keep in mind that this sample size is there for a reason : ensure that our test has a certain&#xA0;<strong>statistical power</strong>&#xA0;given a chosen confidence level and an estimated minimal difference in user behaviour (for example, a test with a power of 80%, a confidence level of 95% and a detectable user difference of 0.03% between a click-through rate of 1.5% on page A vs 1.53% on page B requires 2 602 422 visits on each version of the website). Indeed, stopping a test earlier reduces its power and hence its ability to return the correct rollout. Simply put, a shortened test will be wrong more often. In the end, what we want to know is if the&#xA0;<strong>trade-off</strong>&#xA0;is in our favour: in time, will the company&#x2019;s online revenues increase if it decides to set up&#xA0;<strong>more shortened tests with less accuracy</strong>&#xA0;?</p><p>All the research necessary for this article was done with the support of<em>&#xA0;Pierre et Vacances Center Parcs&#xA0;</em>(PVCP), who accompanied us throughout our work and gave us access to some of their real-life A/B tests so that we could put our theoretical results to the test.</p><p><em>We&#x2019;ve made a good talk with&#xA0;</em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shifanjuan/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Fanjuan Shi</em></a><em>, from Pierre et Vacances Center Parcs about this research, with great work of&#xA0;</em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrien-salem-sermanet-1763bb19b/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Adrien Salem</em></a><em>&#xA0;here at&#xA0;</em><a href=\"http://www.datama.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><em>DataMa</em></a><em>.

The required sample size is calculated based on an estimated uplift between the two versions of the website, and the decision is only made once it has been reached. This process is applied even if a significant result appears early on, to avoid early fake positive. But doing so prevents us from making early decisions and moving on to other tests, which can be in our interest in some cases that we will have to define.</p><p>The goal of this article is to challenge these approaches (i.e. methods, confidence levels and stop time). To do so, we have considered&#xA0;<strong>6 methodologies</strong>&#xA0;(including the two previous ones) used in the web and pharma industries to make statistically backed decisions as well as different&#xA0;<strong>CLs (confidence levels)</strong>&#xA0;ranging from 95% down to 50%. We have applied them to both 5 sets of 30 simulated tests and 10 real-life tests run on PVCP websites of varying magnitude (from 5,000 to 500,000 sessions/week). We have chosen to keep the two current approaches in our study and take their efficiency as a baseline to which we can refer when comparing other methods/CLs.</p><p>From now on, we will stop a test&#xA0;<strong>as soon as we reach significance</strong>, regardless of the required sample size. As you will have no doubt already guessed, this significance (and the decision that it induces) will change with the different methods and CLs, and we will hence try to come up with&#xA0;<strong>the most accurate bundle/package of method + CL</strong>&#xA0;to replace the traditional approaches described above. However, to avoid stopping a test with insufficient data and making too many errors, we have decided to always wait for at least 100 conversions on each version and for a whole week of testing, in order to account for the real-life varying traffic throughout the week. Finally, the testing duration is limited to 12 weeks (i.e. 3 months) which is a standard duration in A/B testing.</p><p>Before we go any further, let me quickly describe the different methods that we will be discussing:</p><p><strong>1/ Frequentist</strong>:&#xA0;<strong>Welsh t test</strong>&#xA0;used either once the required sample size is reached or as soon as a significant result appears.</p><p><strong>2/ Bayesian</strong>: Same as frequentist but with a&#xA0;<strong>Bayesian test</strong>.</p><p><strong>3/ Chi squared</strong>&#xA0;: Chi squared&#xA0;<strong>independence test</strong>&#xA0;is used to see if there is a&#xA0;<strong>significant difference</strong>&#xA0;between a certain category of 2 variables. In our case, we compare the number of conversions and sessions (categories) on the two versions of the website (variables). This method is rarely used in A/B testing.</p><p><strong>4/ LD Bounds</strong>&#xA0;: We end the test as soon as the&#xA0;<strong>Z-score</strong>&#xA0;(same as the frequentist t-score) becomes either&#xA0;<strong>drastically too small</strong>&#xA0;(below the futility boundary) or&#xA0;<strong>too large</strong>&#xA0;(above the efficacy boundary). The test eventually terminates since the two boundaries meet at the end. This method widely used in medical trials where making a decision as early as possible is crucial.</p><p><strong>5/ Permutation</strong>&#xA0;: We&#xA0;<strong>combine samples</strong>&#xA0;(a bunch of 0s and 1s where a 0 corresponds to a session without conversion and 1 to a conversion) together and randomly pick observations (still the 0s and 1s)&#xA0;<strong>without replacement&#xA0;</strong>to form new samples. Compute the statistic (ie difference of means=conversion rate in our case) on each permutation to yield a&#xA0;<strong>distribution</strong>&#xA0;and compare the original statistic to it. We use the&#xA0;<strong>p-value</strong>&#xA0;to conclude (as in the Welch t test). This method is especially convenient for multi-testing (more than 2 versions of a website).</p><p><strong>6/ Bootstrap</strong>&#xA0;: Same as the permutation method but&#xA0;<strong>with replacement</strong>&#xA0;when forming new samples. This is another resampling procedure mainly used to assess the reliability of an estimate.</p><p>It is now time to put all these methods and CLs to the test ! To do so, we firstly compared the different roll-outs on isolated tests. But to be more precise, we then considered the&#xA0;<strong>ideal</strong>,&#xA0;<strong>assessed</strong>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<strong>real accumulated uplifts</strong>&#xA0;(IAC, AAC and RAC respectively) in conversion rate and then in actual revenues on a set of tests.</p><div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"><img alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D12AQFydUhAjJYUFA/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1608193540283?e=1740009600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=C7B9e8Sr_uYk8XOnVHrgsMAESsdG9R_RhRIkkJBb-B4\" src=\"//:0\"></div><p><br></p><p>For each Methodology and Confidence level, we&#x2019;re able to compare the assessed, ideal and actual uplift resulting from our AB test</p><p>Let me define those terms : for a given set of tests, the ideal accumulated uplift would be the maximum uplift that a company could get if its teams made all the right decisions, the assessed accumulated uplift is the uplift a certain method thinks we end up with and the real accumulated uplift is the one we&#xA0;<strong>really</strong>&#xA0;end up with based on the decisions made by a certain method.</p><p>In addition, we can add a duration factor by considering the time each method took before reaching the end of the set of tests. One way to do that is by calculating yearly ideal, assessed and real accumulated uplifts. These indicators show both the accuracy and the efficiency of the different methods at varying CLs. Keep in mind that all of this is only possible if many A/B tests of good quality are ready to be put in production !</p><h2>3. Analysis of the simulations</h2><p><em>3.1 Simulated test example</em></p><p>Before diving more deeply into the analysis of the simulation, let us first look at&#xA0;<strong>one isolated test</strong>. This is test number 16 of the 5th set of 30 tests, it has a real uplift of -0.6% and we have chosen a confidence level of 90% (i.e. an alpha = the probability of a type-I error of 0.1). Each&#xA0;<strong>arrow</strong>&#xA0;corresponds to the decision made after an additional week of data gathering (approximately 260,000 sessions per week in this example) : grey and small means no decision whereas coloured and large means that a decision has been made by a certain method. Finally, the x-axis corresponds to the current number of sessions as weeks go by and the y-axis to the assessed uplifts.</p><div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"><img alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D12AQF1cW-tytK5jw/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1608193565974?e=1740009600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=5OriVIbM6r6g0daz109b7i3uMIsKs2XxOsLGQ9cuulk\" src=\"//:0\"></div><p>We can clearly notice that the&#xA0;<strong>roll-outs differ with the method</strong>&#xA0;: after only 3 weeks, the permutation method wrongly concludes a positive roll-out; chi squared is still indecisive after 12 weeks; the other methods are all correct but at different times&#x2026; Obviously, since the&#xA0;<strong>real uplift is close to zero</strong>, there is a high chance of ending up with the wrong outcomes, all the more so if the decision is made early on.</p><p>3.2.&#xA0;<em>Accumulated uplifts for a set of 30 simulated tests</em></p><p>Let us now focus on how each method fares on a whole set of 30 simulated tests given a 90% confidence level. The following graph shows the&#xA0;<strong>ideal</strong>&#xA0;accumulated uplift, which is the same regardless of the method, as well as the&#xA0;<strong>real</strong>&#xA0;accumulated uplifts as we go through the 30 tests and the&#xA0;<strong>assessed</strong>&#xA0;accumulated uplifts for each method.</p><div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"><img alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D12AQHKoM6k0_fhWw/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1608193582630?e=1740009600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=q5OEgbswWQwiZe8rQuLuoCh65JBLgdafJFa4qG4m5OU\" src=\"//:0\"></div><p><br></p><p>While the real accumulated uplift is approximately the same, the&#xA0;<strong>time</strong>&#xA0;(i.e. number of sessions) taken by each method varies a lot. Furthermore, the assessed accumulated uplift is always&#xA0;<strong>higher</strong>&#xA0;than the real and ideal ones, especially for the bootstrap and Bayesian methods. This is something to remember: when an analytics team announces a certain estimated uplift, it will most probably be&#xA0;<strong>overestimated</strong>&#xA0;!</p><p>3.3.&#xA0;<em>Real uplift vs Ideal uplift</em></p><p>Before moving on to the final and most conclusive graph, we will look at the&#xA0;<strong>impact of the confidence level on the accuracy</strong>. Indeed, for now, we have only considered a confidence level of 90%, which seems arbitrary. It seems natural that the accuracy, which is measured as the&#xA0;<strong>average of the real over the ideal accumulated uplift</strong>, tends to decrease as the confidence level decreases since the decisions are made with less data and hence less precision.</p><p>However, for very high confidence levels, the accuracy can be lower (chi squared, LD bounds). In these cases, the required sample size is often higher than the number of sessions reached within 12 weeks (maximum duration of a test) : we are thus ending many tests without any decision. Furthermore, the &#x201C;full_freq&#x201D; and &#x201C;full_bayes&#x201D; methods, which correspond to the current methods used (i.e. a frequentist or Bayesian test once the required sample size is reached and not before), show&#xA0;<strong>similar behaviours</strong>&#xA0;and do not seem to be affected that much by the choice of the confidence level.&#xA0;<strong>The permutation and bootstrap methods, on the other hand, have a better accuracy</strong>&#xA0;than the two former ones for high confidence levels.</p><div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"><img alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D12AQGAi-RxLakjXQ/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1608193602805?e=1740009600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=WQA7UpjrTkjhv8HBy1YDjm7w1BGAsply9gcU9Tvat0c\" src=\"//:0\"></div><p><br></p><p>3.4.&#xA0;<em>Total gain in conversion relative to current methodology</em></p><p>Finally, it is time to look at a graph which takes all of this into account : the&#xA0;<strong>accuracy</strong>&#xA0;and the&#xA0;<strong>time taken to make these decisions</strong>.</p><div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"><img alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D12AQG9C9gD5LFfvA/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1608193615244?e=1740009600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=ZbyPnv8tZ12AKRANnx_Nfs_gxJqFvwLNbvd7NehYUeY\" src=\"//:0\"></div><p><br></p><p>The y-axis represents the average gain in conversion compared to the current situation (i.e. the &#x201C;full_bayes&#x201D; method with a 95% confidence level). The figures on the curves show the factor of more tests we would need to run if we chose a certain method and confidence level. As expected, decreasing the confidence level radically decreases the duration of the test. Hence, we can simulate the additional uplift that could be taken if we were to run more tests during the saved time. Overall,&#xA0;<strong>this widely compensates the loss in accuracy</strong>: decreasing the confidence level by 5% allows us to run almost twice as many tests, so&#xA0;<em>theoretically,&#xA0;</em>to double the final uplift,&#xA0;<strong>as long as these new tests are just as good</strong>. However, in real life, implementing twice as many tests of the same high quality is not that easy. All we are saying here is that, from a statistical point of view, the more tests we have, the lower the confidence level can be and the higher the accumulated uplift becomes.</p><p>3.5.&#xA0;<em>Estimation is not reality</em></p><p>One last side note before the conclusion of this article the&#xA0;<strong>assessed uplifts are not reality</strong>. Indeed, as mentioned earlier, the assessed uplifts are always&#xA0;<strong>higher</strong>&#xA0;than the real uplifts, and this is ever more substantial as the confidence level decreases. Furthermore, while being much longer to run, &#x201C;full_bayes&#x201D; methodology is also much&#xA0;<strong>more accurate</strong>&#xA0;in the assessment of the implemented uplift (the ratio is very close to 1). Regarding all the other methods which stop tests earlier, the assessed uplifts are even less accurate. However,&#xA0;<strong>what really matters is the real uplift and not its estimation</strong>, so even if a method is not very accurate, it is worth trying out as long as it can allow us to run more tests with a satisfactory real uplift. In a nutshell, keep in mind that while assessed uplifts are always higher than real ones, it is not necessarily a drawback.</p><div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"><img alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D12AQEPG57P3fRhEA/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1608193639208?e=1740009600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=1sxgtZVe6Ekcy4fP_Goq0kxmFaxSCKFWacdIze5tZ18\" src=\"//:0\"></div><h2><strong>4.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Recommendations and final conclusion</strong></h2><div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"><img alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D12AQGWMszJ_JvtmQ/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/article-inline_image-shrink_400_744/0/1608193721199?e=1740009600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=B0r-pHD1eTJ8ZOy7MG7XKz-tcxpCM93_ugkixewxdFA\" src=\"//:0\"></div><p>First outcome of our simulation is that the Bootstrap<strong>&#xA0;method seems to be the winning method</strong>&#xA0;for high confidence level (&gt;85%). Switching from full Bayesian to Bootstrap could give PVCP an uplift of ~2% just by making the right decisions more often. While this method is hard to compute in a simple Excel spreadsheet, we&#x2019;ve built a tool (<a href=\"https://datama.fr/datamaimpact/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">DataMa Impact</a>) that allows for doing it simply.</p><p>Second outcome is that surprisingly, based on simulated tests (150 tests), it seems that even at the current level of confidence (95%), waiting for the estimated duration could be avoided without much cost. If we respect the rule of having more than 100 conversions on each version of our website, we could already&#xA0;<strong>reduce the duration of tests by ~2 and more than double our real uplift while keeping the same accuracy in roll out decisions if we believe we can implement 2 times more tests of the same quality</strong>.</p><p>Furthermore,<strong>&#xA0;decreasing the level of confidence to 85% could allow us to divide the time of run of AB tests by another ~1.9, and, assuming that we could use this saved time to run more AB tests of the same quality, this could end up in another x1.6 increase in the conversion improvement</strong>&#xA0;compared to what we have today in a year.</p><p>Back testing this recommended approach on real-life tests shows that we would have taken the same decision in 10 out of 10 considered tests, while decreasing their cumulative duration by ~50%, which is reassuring.</p><p>One important note: changing methodology comes with a slight cost in measurement accuracy: the estimated uplift that we report on a yearly basis with current methodology is about +20% higher than the real uplift that we actually get on our site. This could go as high as +85% if we switch the methodology to bootstrap and decrease the confidence level to 90%. It is an important data point to keep in mind while measuring website progress and financial benefits/ ROI of the experimentation team.</p><p>One last key learning is that the actual uplift that we implement on our websites is about 85% of the one in an &#x2018;ideal world&#x2019; where we would always make the right decision.</p><p>For the last time, all this increase in uplifts can only happen if many AB tests of good quality are ready to go: the limit is not set by statistics theory, but by the efficiency of a company&#x2019;s AB testing teams !</p>",
