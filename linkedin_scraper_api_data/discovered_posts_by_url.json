    "post_text": "C’è differenza tra marketing e branding. Molti credono che siano la stessa cosa, ma non è così. Cos’è il marketing ? Il marketing è una spinta specifica che incoraggia i consumatori ad acquistare un prodotto o un servizio in base all’ efficacia , la popolarità o l’ utilità di quel prodotto o servizio. Più semplicemente, il marketing è la cassa di risonanza che viene utilizzata per diffondere e vendere prodotti o servizi in base alle caratteristiche dette prima. Cos’è il branding? Il branding comunica i valori essenziali , unici e differenzianti di un’azienda ad una fetta di clienti ben precisa. Chiede al consumatore di sostenere e scegliere l’azienda e non il singolo prodotto. Il marketing è tattico, destinato a produrre un risultato specifico in un periodo di tempo ridotto . Una campagna di marketing ben fatta può aumentare le vendite, ma tende ad essere un’eccezione di breve durata piuttosto che un effetto duraturo. Inoltre, l’azienda si presta ad assumere volti diversi nei messaggi delle varie campagne, a seconda dello scopo di marketing che intende raggiungere. Il branding invece, comunica i valori distintivi di una marca che restano impressi nella mente del consumatore anche dopo specifiche campagne di marketing. Per esempio, nell’effettuare un acquisto il cliente comprende e vive l’esperienza che la Marca del prodotto o servizio ha alle spalle. Il branding crea lealtà e coltiva rapporti di fiducia longevi tra aziende e consumatori . Uno dei canali per creare e tenere vivo questo tipo di rapporto e tramite cui sviluppare una strategia di branding è sicuramente quello digitale ( Digital branding ). Digital Branding Nel mercato digitale, le aziende hanno innumerevoli opportunità di promuoversi, ma spesso non sanno da dove iniziare oppure lo fanno ad intermittenza, in maniera scoordinata, senza tener conto dei propri valori e senza fidelizzare l’utente facendogli vivere l’esperienza che la Marca promette. Dobbiamo fare in modo che il cliente specifico si identifichi e viva i valori distintivi della Marca che ha scelto . Un’attività di d igital branding ben fatta è orientata a tutto questo. Attraverso una corretta combinazione di strumenti quali content marketing , influencer marketing , SEO , social media e advertising online. Conclusione In estrema sintesi, il branding permette di avere un ruolo definito nella mente del consumatore riducendo di molto la probabilità di essere spazzato via da una concorrenza basata sul prezzo o di essere in balia delle fluttuazioni del mercato. PS: ovviamente l'attività di branding non esclude quella di marketing, ma diciamo che una ben fatta attività di marketing parte da una strategia branding definita.",

    "post_text": "Come si crea un contenuto virale? Perché tutti farebbero carte false pur di saperlo? Ogni giorno sui social vengono condivise milioni di informazioni che influenzano il nostro comportamento e il nostro modo di pensare. La viralità è uno dei fenomeni più importanti del 21esimo secolo . Social Media Manager e addetti web ogni giorno sono attenti e alla ricerca delle parole migliori da utilizzare nei loro contenuti. Sono sempre più convinto che chi lavora nell’ambito della comunicazione (marketing, branding, design, copy, strategia SEO ecc..) non possa ignorare i progressi del neuromarketing e delle neuroscienze sociali nel comprendere come il nostro cervello guida le nostre scelte e i nostri comportamenti di tutti i giorni. Recentemente sono stati condotti studi neuroscientifici proprio su questo argomento e i risultati sono assolutamente interessanti. Per capirne meglio il senso mi sono confrontato con Nicoletta Agostinelli , laureata in neuroscienze e neuropsicologia all'Università di Bologna, che mi ha illustrato due recenti ricerche condotte presso il Communication Neuroscience Lab dell’Università del Pennsylvania. Secondo C. Scholz e E. Baek , principali autori di questi esperimenti, esistono delle specifiche aree cerebrali che cooperano nel valutare i diversi contenuti in cui ci imbattiamo tutti i giorni; da questa attivazione neurale si genera un segnale che inconsciamente predice se condivideremo o meno quel contenuto. Il valore risultante da questo processo di valutazione corrisponderebbe proprio alla probabilità che un contenuto ha di diventare virale . Le aree cerebrali in questione sono legate alla riflessione su di sé , sulle proprie esperienze e sugli stati mentali altrui e fanno parte del cosiddetto circuito del “ mentalizing ”: nel decidere se condividere o meno un articolo formuliamo delle aspettative sulle conseguenze sociali (potenziali reazioni altrui, significato che potrà assumere per chi lo leggerà) ma anche personali (quanto quell’azione sia utile ad arricchire l’immagine di noi stessi e le nostre relazioni sociali) e, s ulla base di queste, attribuiamo un giudizio a quel contenuto. Nello studio realizzato da questi ricercatori sono stati selezionati degli articoli del New York Times relativi alla salute e al benessere ed è stato chiesto ai partecipanti all’esperimento di scegliere quali articoli leggere e quali condividere, il tutto mentre veniva registrata in tempo reale la loro attività cerebrale mediante fMRI ( functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) . I risultati mostrano che sia nello scegliere cosa leggere per sé stessi , sia nel decidere cosa condividere (e consigliare) agli altri , i partecipanti attivavano proprio aree appartenenti al circuito del mentalizing . E’ interessante notare come anche nello scegliere cosa leggere per interesse personale “pensiamo socialmente” e attiviamo le stesse aree che utilizziamo quando riflettiamo su cosa consigliare agli altri: la comprensione del mondo sociale e il concetto di Sé sono strettamente intrecciati e si influenzano reciprocamente. “When you’re thinking about what to read yourself and about what to share, both are inherently social, and when you’re thinking socially, you’re often thinking about yourself and your relationships to others,” says Baek. “Your self-concept and understanding of the social world are intertwined.” In un secondo studio lo stesso gruppo di ricerca ha dimostrato che è possibile utilizzare il segnale cerebrale generato da queste aree per predire quanto un contenuto sarà virale nel mondo dei lettori. In particolare, sono riusciti a predire quanto un articolo del New York Times sarebbe stato virale nell’ampio network dei lettori online, semplicemente partendo dall’analisi dell’attività neurale degli 80 partecipanti all’esperimento. Il fatto che sia possibile fare conclusioni di così ampio raggio a partire dallo studio dei processi neurali di scelta in un piccolo gruppo di soggetti suggerisce che, sebbene gli articoli che leggiamo ogni giorno suscitano pensieri e considerazioni diverse in ognuno di noi, le motivazioni e i principi che guidano la decisione di leggere e condividere proprio quegli articoli sono gli stessi e sfruttano gli stessi meccanismi neurali. “If we can use a small number of brains to predict what large numbers of people who read the New York Times are doing, it means that similar things are happening across people,” says Scholz. “The fact that the articles strike the same chord in different brains suggests that similar motivations and similar norms may be driving these behaviours. Similar things have value in our broader society.” Le informazioni che producono maggiori risposte in aree del cervello dedicate alla riflessione su se stessi, alla cognizione sociale e al giudizio sul valore delle cose hanno più probabilità di essere condivise e diventare virali. Le dinamiche neuropsicologiche devono essere prese in considerazione quando andiamo a creare un contenuto web, a maggior ragione se abbiamo l’ambizione che diventi virale. Molti credono che la viralità sia dovuta alla fortuna o al giusto canale che il contenuto prende nel web, invece ci sono delle precise sensazioni, emozioni, aree del cervello da stimolare e a cui mirare, ovviamente scegliendo o creando il giusto contenuto.

Il fatto che sia possibile fare <strong>conclusioni di cos&#xEC; ampio raggio</strong> a partire dallo studio dei processi neurali di scelta in un piccolo gruppo di soggetti suggerisce che, sebbene gli articoli che leggiamo ogni giorno suscitano pensieri e considerazioni diverse in ognuno di noi, le motivazioni e i principi che guidano la decisione di leggere e condividere proprio quegli articoli sono gli stessi e sfruttano gli stessi meccanismi neurali.</p> \n  <blockquote>\n    &#xA0; \n   <em>&#x201C;If we can use a small number of brains to predict what large numbers of people who read the&#xA0;New York Times are doing, it means that similar things are happening across people,&#x201D; says Scholz. &#x201C;The fact that the articles strike the same chord in different brains suggests that similar motivations and similar norms may be driving these behaviours.&#xA0;Similar things have value in our broader society.&#x201D;</em> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Le informazioni che producono maggiori risposte in aree del cervello dedicate alla riflessione su se stessi, alla cognizione sociale e al giudizio sul valore delle cose hanno pi&#xF9; probabilit&#xE0; di essere condivise e diventare virali.&#xA0;</p> \n  <p><strong>Le dinamiche&#xA0;neuropsicologiche&#xA0;devono essere prese in considerazione</strong> quando andiamo a creare un contenuto web, a maggior ragione se&#xA0;abbiamo&#xA0;l&#x2019;ambizione che diventi virale.<em>&#xA0;</em>&#xA0;Molti credono che la viralit&#xE0; sia dovuta alla fortuna o al giusto canale che il contenuto prende nel web, invece ci sono delle&#xA0;<strong>precise&#xA0;sensazioni, emozioni, aree del cervello da&#xA0;stimolare e a cui mirare,</strong> ovviamente scegliendo o creando il giusto contenuto.</p> \n  <p><br></p> \n  <p><br></p> \n  <p><strong>Fonti</strong>: Scholz, C., Baek, E.

Combining Boston Dynamics' expertise in humanoid robotics and TRI's cutting-edge AI, this collaboration seeks to advance the development of general-purpose humanoid robots. Key Highlights: Boston Dynamics brings the advanced capabilities of its Atlas robot, which is designed for extreme mobility and bimanual manipulation. TRI will integrate its Large Behavior Models (LBMs) and state-of-the-art AI, including groundbreaking diffusion policy techniques, to enhance dexterous robotic manipulation. The partnership will leverage both companies' strengths, pushing AI-driven robotics that address real-world challenges. Leadership: Scott Kuindersma, Senior Director of Robotics Research at Boston Dynamics, and Russ Tedrake, Vice President of Robotics Research at TRI, will lead the collaboration. Together, they will focus on improving humanoid robot abilities, including multi-tasking and human-robot interaction, while ensuring safety and practical utility. With this partnership, Boston Dynamics and TRI aim to create robots that amplify human abilities and improve quality of life. 🧠Meta Works on a New LLM That Will Think More Profoundly Meta researchers, in collaboration with UC Berkeley and NYU, have developed a state-of-the-art method that they have termed \"Thought Preference Optimization,\" or simply TPO , designed to make AI models more introspective before they return answers. This new approach presses the AI system to simulate thoughtful consideration, promising improved performance on a wide array of general tasks. What is unique about the TPO? While most former \"chain-of-thought\" approaches have been applied to logical/mathematical reasoning tasks, TPO has the capability to improve a diverse range of processes, from creative writing and marketing to health, thus becoming a useful tool in many AI applications. In particular, the authors note that in the process of producing a final answer, the AI generates internal \"thought steps,\" and only the final response is judged, enabling the AI to learn to reason implicitly. How TPO Works The AI model is prompted to generate a sequence of internal thoughts before giving an answer. Several outputs are produced from these musings. It is assumed by the scoring model that the evaluator scores only the final outputs. The AI learns by optimizing its preferences based on these evaluations. Faltering at Math An 8B Llama 3 model with TPO outperformed models without explicit reasoning in benchmarks like AlpacaEval, achieving win rates as high as 52.5%. Interestingly, in mathematical tasks, TPO performed worse, with its performance actually decreasing. This leads to an interesting conclusion: while TPO has broad applicability, it is not well-suited for highly specialized tasks, such as mathematics, which require alternative strategies. Researchers consider TPO to be a stepping stone allowing AI models to engage in more general tasks thoughtfully and broadly. This leaves room open for future research questions, such as, how to study mechanisms for controlling the complexity of thought processes and how these methods scale with larger models. Meta's invention represents a bold leap into the future of AI and possibly the beginning of \"smart-thinking systems\" in many industries. 🚗All the Reveals from We, Robot 2024 Chief Executive Elon Musk presented some highly future-faced additions at Tesla's \"We, Robot\" event, a highly eagerly awaited event. The long-anticipated autonomous Cybercab and even a surprise Robovan delighted fans! Flashy demonstrations stirred the excitement, but without specific production timelines for those products, investors were left unimpressed, and the result was a 7% drop in Tesla's stock after the event revealed key innovations regarding Tesla's future in full autonomous mode. Cybercab: The Driverless Future The Cybercab, represents Musk's latest dream of an autonomous, two-seat robotaxi sans wheel and pedals. Musk promises new safety features and a way to save time with the Cybercab—to be priced under $30,000—with production targeted for 2026 or 2027. Still, a question mark remains over Tesla's ambitious timelines. Your New Home Assistant Robot: Optimus Tesla's humanoid robot, Optimus, also made an appearance and was shown to be able to mingle with attendees, serve drinks, and could even play games. Elon sees Optimus as an affordable helper—a \"general-purpose robot\" for everything from housework to just hanging out with you—that at large-scale production could bring radical change to many industries. Robovan: Tesla's High-Density Solution Another big surprise was the Robovan, which would transport up to 20 people. Musk claimed it could serve as a school bus, move cargo, or even an RV—all to help lower travel costs. The cost and how many will be produced are still unmentioned, except that the Robovan showed Tesla's step toward bigger transportation, at least some of which can be shared. Autonomous Driving - 2025 Musk said that this would start with Model Y and Model 3s in California and Texas by 2025. Tesla has made perhaps the most meaningful progress toward full self-driving mode, putting it on a competitive footing with the well-funded challengers such as Waymo and Cruise in the race to own the autonomous roads of the future. The \"We, Robot\" event set some pretty bold expectations for the future with Tesla's autonomous vehicle ambitions. Whether Tesla can meet these ambitious goals, only time will tell. 🎮 AI-Powered Counter-Strike Simulation Shows Potential Researchers from the University of Geneva, University of Edinburgh, and Microsoft have developed DIAMOND, an AI model that simulates Counter-Strike within a neural network. This breakthrough allows the AI to generate an interactive version of the game at 10 frames per second. Details : DIAMOND employs a diffusion-based model, predicting the next frame based on previous gameplay and user actions. It was trained on just 87 hours of CS gameplay, far less than similar projects like Google's DOOM simulation. Players can interact with the AI-generated simulation using standard inputs (keyboard and mouse), recreating elements such as weapon mechanics and player interactions. DIAMOND achieved state-of-the-art performance, with a 46% better-than-human score on the Atari 100k benchmark for agents trained on a world model. DIAMOND shows that AI can recreate complex, interactive environments with minimal data, offering potential for robotics, autonomous systems, and video game creation. This technology could revolutionize AI training in real-world applications and take game development to new levels. 🔮 Anthropic CEO Publishes Visionary Essay on AI and Society's Future In a thought-provoking new essay, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei dives deep into the dual nature of artificial intelligence. He presents an intriguing vision of a future where AI not only enhances our lives but also raises important questions about the risks involved. This piece offers a balanced perspective on how AI could reshape various aspects of society over the next decade, including healthcare, democracy, and the economy. Details: Amodei predicts that by 2026, we could see AI systems surpassing human intelligence in various fields, integrating agentic and multimodal capabilities. He proposes a \"compressed 21st century,\" where AI could condense a century’s worth of medical and biological advancements into just 5-10 years, potentially curing many diseases and extending human life significantly. The essay also explores how AI could enhance democracy by combating misinformation and providing tools to challenge authoritarian regimes, countering fears of AI's misuse. While acknowledging potential job displacement, he remains hopeful that new economic models will evolve to adapt to the changing landscape. Amodei stresses the importance of ensuring that the benefits of AI growth are equitably shared among all, rather than concentrated in the hands of a few. Amodei’s essay is a wake-up call. It reminds us that AI has the potential to bring about real positive change, but we must pay attention to the risks. This isn’t just about tech; it’s about our lives and our future. By addressing both the possibilities and the dangers, we can start important conversations about how to use AI responsibly. Ensuring everyone benefits from these advancements is crucial.

    "post_text": "💻OpenAI Unveils 'Canvas' Interface for ChatGPT: A Game-Changer for Writing and Coding Projects As AI technology rapidly advances, we're seeing a fascinating evolution in how we interact with AI models. Three recent innovations - OpenAI's Canvas, Anthropic's Artifacts, and Google's NotebookLM - represent different approaches to solving a common challenge: moving beyond simple chat interfaces to enable more sophisticated collaboration between humans and AI. Core Focus Canvas : Emphasizes real-time collaboration on writing and coding projects Artifacts : Facilitates sharing substantial, standalone content in a separate window NotebookLM : Specializes in document analysis, note-taking, and information organization Interface Design All three tools recognize the limitations of traditional chat interfaces and offer separate workspaces: Canvas opens automatically when needed Artifacts appear in a dedicated side window NotebookLM provides a comprehensive environment for working with multiple sources Key Strengths Canvas Seamless integration with ChatGPT Specialized shortcuts for common tasks Focus on iterative editing and refinement Artifacts Versatility in content types (code, documents, SVGs, React components) Version control functionality Clear criteria for when to use artifacts NotebookLM Powerful source management and citation Multi-modal capability (text and images) Strong focus on research and learning workflows What fascinates me most is how these tools reflect different philosophies about human-AI collaboration. Canvas seems to position AI as a creative partner, Artifacts treats AI as a content generator, and NotebookLM views AI as an research assistant and information organizer. The development of these interfaces also reveals important trends: Moving Beyond Chat : All three tools recognize that complex tasks require more sophisticated interfaces than simple back-and-forth chat. Context is King : Each solution prioritizes maintaining context - whether it's the full view of a coding project in Canvas, the self-contained nature of Artifacts, or the source-based approach of NotebookLM. Specialization vs. Versatility : We see a tension between specialized tools (NotebookLM for research) and more versatile ones (Canvas and Artifacts for various types of content). Integration and Future Predictions Looking ahead, I predict: Convergence of Features : We'll likely see these tools borrowing from each other. For instance, Canvas might adopt NotebookLM's citation capabilities, while NotebookLM could implement Canvas-like editing shortcuts. Enhanced Multimodal Capabilities : As AI models become more adept at handling various types of content, these interfaces will evolve to support richer, more diverse media types. Standardization : Common patterns may emerge across different platforms, leading to more standardized ways of interacting with AI for specific tasks. Personalization : Future iterations might offer more customizable interfaces that adapt to individual working styles and preferences. These three innovations represent different paths toward the same goal: enabling more meaningful human-AI collaboration. While they take different approaches, together they paint a picture of a future where AI tools are not just chatbots, but sophisticated partners in our creative and analytical processes. The key to success will be finding the right balance between specialized functionality and user-friendly interfaces. Join the largest Generative AI community to help shaping the future of AI Generative AI addresses a gap in the AI space by combating the confusion and intimidation surrounding AI.

The company's meteoric rise—valued at a jaw-dropping $157 billion📈 as they predict $5 billion loss in 2024—has Altman playing the role of a modern tech king, backed by financial giants like Microsoft, Nvidia, and SoftBank. His return after being dramatically ousted last year was like Jon Snow's resurrection—back from the dead, with the backing of 800 loyal OpenAI employees who threatened to follow him to Microsoft if the board didn’t reinstate him. Not just a victory for Altman, it showcased his grip over both the company and the AI industry at large.I still remember Sam Altman on Capitol Hill, famously said he owns no equity in OpenAI and simply earns enough to meet his health insurance bills.😥 And now, as OpenAI restructures into a for-profit benefit corporation, this move seems crafted for Altman to secure even greater influence. The restructuring allows OpenAI to fuel its ambitions with more investor capital while keeping the non-profit as a strategic minority, ensuring Altman can play both sides of the AI coin: idealism and enterprise. Yet, it’s a delicate dance. I think Altman’s ambitions could push him toward unchecked power, much like how the pursuit of the Iron Throne led others down a darker path. The exits of key figures like CTO Mira Murati and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever feel like the crumbling of allegiances. These departures, following the earlier coup attempt, hint at ongoing power struggles within the company. why? Just a natural career progress? As they said \"OpenAI is nothing without its people\"😎 At OpenAI's DevDay, four major updates were announced to enhance AI development: 1️⃣ Model Distillation: Fine-tune smaller models using outputs from larger models for better performance. 2️⃣ Prompt Caching: Reuse common prompts at a 50% discount, reducing API costs for developers. 3️⃣ Vision Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune models with images, improving visual recognition for applications like search and medical analysis. 4️⃣ Realtime API: Build speech-to-speech applications with low latency and natural voices, making AI interactions faster and more responsive. The strawberry tactic, new releases and features were a bit underwhelming for AI fans and Sora is still not available. What’s next? It seems that Altman is consolidating power and turning OpenAI into a commercial juggernaut while setting new rules for the AI realm. But as he continues to climb, he faces growing threats from rival AI kingdoms like Anthropic and Meta. Specially from Zuck the new cool kid on the block. Can he keep the balance and push more extraordinary innovations out or will the pursuit of power consume even the most well-meaning leaders?Stay tuned, because this saga is far from over. Generative AI Week | 2024 Event Guide Join us for an inspiring week at Generative AI Week , featuring a meticulously crafted agenda designed to deepen your understanding and spark innovation.

Meta’s AI Innovations and AR Breakthroughs: Smarter, More Creative, and Business-Friendly What a day in the AI world! As someone who's been following this field closely, I'm honestly a bit dizzy from all the news. Let me break down what I think are the biggest stories: 😎Meta's Orion AR glasses - Now this is some sci-fi stuff coming to life. AR glasses with built-in AI that can understand everything you see? Sign me up! 🔥OpenAI's CTO Mira Murati is leaving - This feels huge. Murati was a key player in developing ChatGPT and DALL-E. Her departure, especially right before OpenAI's big developer conference, makes me wonder what's brewing behind the scenes. 📈Meta dropped Llama 3.2 - This is exciting! They're pushing AI to the edge with smaller models that can run on our phones. As someone who loves tinkering with AI, I can't wait to play around with these. It feels like we're watching a game of AI chess: Murati had been with OpenAI for over six years and played a pivotal role during her time as CTO, a position she assumed in May 2022. She briefly stepped into the CEO role during a leadership crisis last November when the board temporarily ousted Altman. Before becoming CTO, Murati served as VP of Applied AI and Partnerships, overseeing key projects such as the launch of GPT-4o, which enabled voice-based AI conversations. Her career before OpenAI includes stints at Tesla and augmented reality startup Leap Motion. Meanwhile, Meta is making bold moves in both AI software (Llama 3.2) and hardware (Orion). Meta usually were on the wrong side of the game but it seems that they are turning the tide!I can't help but think we're at a tipping point. AI is moving from our desktops to our pockets, and soon, right in front of our eyes with AR. Looking ahead, More AI features baked into our everyday devices A fierce battle for AI talent One thing's for sure - the AI landscape is changing faster than ever. As an AI enthusiast, I'm excited, but I also hope we take the time to consider the broader impacts of these technologies. 🚫California Decides in Favour of AI Development, Governor Vetoes ‘AI Safety Bill’ California Governor Gavin Newsom just vetoed a landmark AI safety bill that would have established many of the first AI regulations in the US. The bill would have placed much-needed safety measures, such as obligatory testing on advanced AI models and the use of a \"kill switch\" to shut off malfunctioning systems, but Newsom was worried that it would stifle innovation. While the author of the bill expressed disappointment, there is an entire lobby of people who are thrilled with this development! No points for guessing, it is very obviously tech companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta who had previously come out against the bill, arguing that such regulations would impede crucial AI technology development. The author of the bill, Senator Scott Wiener, warned that unless regulated, AI development would continue to remain unchecked, creating potential public safety risks. Newsom, meanwhile, tried to reassure people by announcing plans to pursue policies addressing AI risks in the future, using expert-led safeguards. This decision outlines a tough balancing act between encouraging technological innovation and ensuring responsible development, especially in California, often dubbed as ‘Silicon Valley’, a global hub for AI advancement. As AI becomes more integrated into everyday life, this pivotal decision is likely to influence future regulatory efforts at both the state and federal levels.

NVIDIA has just unveiled groundbreaking results in the latest MLPerf Inference v4.1 benchmarks: ✔The upcoming NVIDIA Blackwell platform delivers up to 4x more performance than NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs on the Llama 2 70B LLM workload. ✔ NVIDIA Hopper GPUs lead in every generative AI data center test, including Llama 2 70B, GPT-J, Stable Diffusion XL and the new Mixtral 8x7B Mixture-of-Experts LLM. This showcase of NVIDIA's performance leadership spans from data centers to edge devices, powering the next wave of AI-driven applications and services. Here are details as NVIDIA continues to push the boundaries of AI computation! Neural Networks Power Real-Time DOOM Google researchers just unveiled GameNGen, the first game engine entirely driven by a neural model, capable of real-time interaction within complex environments. This groundbreaking AI doesn’t just replicate the classic game DOOM; it simulates it at over 20 frames per second on a single TPU, offering an interactive experience that’s nearly indistinguishable from the original. Details: GameNGen : The AI predicts each frame using a diffusion model, enabling real-time gameplay without traditional game engine components. Training Data : The AI was trained on 900M frames generated by an RL-agent playing DOOM. This extensive dataset allowed GameNGen to learn how to accurately simulate gameplay sequences. Diffusion Model: The system uses a customized version of Stable Diffusion v1.4, conditioned on past frames and actions. To prevent visual degradation during long sequences, the model was trained with deliberately corrupted context frames, which improved its ability to correct errors and maintain visual fidelity. Fine-Tuning: The latent decoder of the model was fine-tuned to address artifacts, particularly in detailed areas like the HUD, improving the overall quality of the generated frames. In tests, human raters could barely distinguish between short clips generated by GameNGen and actual gameplay, with accuracy only slightly better than random chance. GameNGen marks the first instance of an AI model generating a complex, playable video game in real-time without any traditional game engine. Imagine a time where each player’s game is uniquely generated, evolving based on their preferences and playstyle, starting a new AI era of gaming and entertainment. 🤝Arizona State University partners with OpenAI to give education a twist like never before Big news from the desert! Arizona State University (ASU) is making waves in the world of higher education by creating a partnership with OpenAI. The initiative, dubbed ChatGPT Edu, is set to rewrite how we approach teaching, research, and even day-to-day operations on campus. Picture this: students getting real-time feedback on their essays from an AI writing buddy, or future healthcare providers practising their bedside manner with a virtual patient named Sam. Sounds like science fiction, right? Well, it's happening right now at ASU. They aren't stopping there. They've thrown down the gauntlet with an AI Innovation Challenge the faculty really stepped up. We're talking about a whopping 80% of schools and colleges jumping on board in just a few weeks. As we speak, 400 proposals are under review, and over 200 ChatGPT Edu projects are already off the ground. What's in it for the ASU community? Students get a personal writing coach Healthcare students can practise tricky conversations without the stage fright Researchers can fast-track their work (more breakthroughs, less paperwork) ASU President Michael M. Crow is all in, calling innovation their \"most powerful asset\" and betting big on AI to supercharge lifelong learning. However, not everyone's entirely thrilled about this news. Harvard lecturer Erik Baker is waving a red flag, worried that AI might put a dent in students' writing skills. Love it or hate it, ASU's bold move is stirring up quite the conversation. As one of the biggest public universities in the country, all eyes are on this experiment. Could this be the blueprint for higher education in the coming decades? 🧠Scientists looking to harness AI to detect and predict dementia risk in patients Source: BBC News In a landmark initiative, Scottish researchers are harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to predict dementia years before symptoms appear. The project, dubbed Scan-Dan is set to analyze over 1.6 million brain scans from patients across Scotland. Led by a team of 20 researchers from the Universities of Edinburgh and Dundee, this ambitious effort is the largest of its kind in the UK. For the first time, scientists have been granted access to a decade's worth of CT and MRI scans collected during routine clinical care from 2008 to 2018. Key Points: The project aims to identify early molecular changes in the brain that signal dementia. AI will be used to detect patterns in scans that could predict dementia risk. The goal is to create tools to help radiologists detect the disease early. Professor remained optimistic and quoted that: \"While we can't be certain what patterns we'll find, the sheer size of our dataset gives us confidence in identifying dementia's early warning signs.\" Early detection is crucial as it allows for more effective treatments and lifestyle adjustments to slow the disease's progression. While a full product is still years away, this research marks a significant step towards better care for dementia patients.

Stay tuned for more developments in the AI space! 🤖 📚Authors sue Anthropic for training Claude with pirated versions of copyrighted books A group of writers filed a lawsuit against AI company Anthropic, claiming the firm used pirated versions of their copyrighted books without permission to train its AI assistant, Claude. This is the first time authors have targeted Anthropic specifically, though similar cases have been on the rise, against the likes of AI companies like OpenAI. Anthropic, started by former OpenAI employees, has tried to position itself as a responsible player in AI development. Their chatbot Claude can help with various tasks like writing emails, summarizing documents, and holding conversations. However, this lawsuit challenges the company's ethical stance, and questions how it is AI for good when it uses blatantly unathorized materials. The lawsuit makes a few important claims: Claude was allegedly trained using a dataset called The Pile, which the authors say contains unauthorized copies of books. The writers argue that AI learning is different from human learning, and authors should be compensated for the use of their work. They say Anthropic's actions don't line up with its stated commitment to developing AI responsibly. In a way, this Anthropic lawsuit is part of a larger trend of copyright lawsuits against AI companies. Other firms like OpenAI and Microsoft are in the midst of such feuds with well-known writers such as George R.R. Martin and Jodi Picoult. These cases highlight a growing debate about AI companies using large amounts of human-created content without getting permission first. In an era where we constantly debate and deliberate about AI’s role in creative fields and ponder over AI replacing humans, it is indeed puzzling that AI uses human-made material without fairly compensating the owners of the intellectual property! The outcome of this case will set a promising precedent for future usage of available literature in training advanced AI models .",

A groundbreaking new study has exposed a startling trend: over 57% of the content on the internet is now AI-generated. This explosion of AI-created content is not only reshaping the digital landscape but also posing serious challenges to AI tools themselves. The Vicious Cycle of AI-Generated Content AI powerhouses like ChatGPT and Copilot rely on vast troves of internet data for training. However, as the internet becomes increasingly saturated with AI-generated content, these tools are essentially being trained on their own output. This self-referential loop is leading to a concerning degradation in the quality of responses and a rise in misinformation. Copyright Law and AI Training The debate over copyright infringement in AI training has been simmering for some time. While OpenAI's Sam Altman acknowledges the necessity of copyrighted material for creating powerful AI models, copyright law remains a murky area. This legal ambiguity has created a complex landscape for AI developers. The Consequences of Model Collapse The study by AWS researchers found that the overreliance on AI-generated content can lead to \"model collapse.\" This phenomenon occurs when AI models become so reliant on their own output that they lose their ability to generate accurate and diverse responses. The researchers warn that model collapse can have serious consequences, including a decline in the quality of information and an increase in misinformation. The Future of AI and Search To ensure the continued development of reliable and informative AI tools, it is imperative to address the challenges posed by AI-generated content. This may involve developing new copyright laws, improving AI training methods, and promoting fact-checking and verification practices. The proliferation of AI-generated content raises profound questions about the future of AI and search. As AI tools become more sophisticated, it will become increasingly difficult to distinguish between human-generated and AI-generated content. This could have far-reaching implications for everything from education and journalism to legal and medical research. 🏛️ AI Agents Form Civilizations in Minecraft Image Source: Altera Altera’s Project Sid has just created the first simulation of over 1,000 fully autonomous AI agents working together in a virtual Minecraft world.

Bloomberg reports that Nvidia received a civil investigative demand, similar to a subpoena. The DOJ seeks to learn information about its business practices and most recent acquisitions. At the heart of the investigation lies the concern that Nvidia, who essentially monopolizes the AI chip market with 70-95% share, may be engaging in anti-competitive behavior. Allegations suggest the company might be penalizing customers who don't exclusively use its AI chips, potentially making it difficult for buyers to switch to alternative suppliers. The DOJ's inquiry may have followed complaints from Nvidia's competitors about possible market power abuse. Regulators in South Korea, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and China have also requested information about Nvidia's operations, adding to the company's regulatory challenges. Key Points: 1. The DOJ is examining Nvidia's $700 million acquisition of RunAI, an AI management firm. 2. Major tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Google heavily rely on Nvidia's AI chip technology. 3. Despite the regulatory pressure, Nvidia's stock has surged 141% this year, driven by AI-related optimism. NVIDIA’s Denial: Nvidia has firmly denied receiving a subpoena from the DOJ. The company's spokesperson stated that they confirmed it with the DOJ. While refuting these reports, Nvidia expressed willingness to address any regulatory questions about its business practices. As the investigation unfolds, investors and industry watchers will be closely monitoring how Nvidia navigates these legal and competitive challenges in the dynamic AI landscape. 🔥Elon Musk Unveils xAI Colossus, a Supercomputer to train Grok Elon Musk's AI company, xAI, has launched Colossus, a supremely powerful and futuristic supercomputer designed to train its large language model, Grok.

    "post_text": "📢 OpenAI Announces SearchGPT, Its AI-Powered Search Engine OpenAI has unveiled SearchGPT, a new AI-powered search engine designed to provide real-time access to information across the Internet. This innovative tool, aimed at rivaling Google and Perplexity, is initially available as a prototype in limited release. Plans are to integrate it into ChatGPT in the future. Key Features of SearchGPT Real-Time Information: Provides up-to-date information across the web, organizing and summarizing search results. Interactive Queries: Users can ask follow-up questions and explore related links through a sidebar. Visual Answers: Includes features for visual responses, such as AI-generated videos and images (specific details pending). Availability and Initial Access SearchGPT is currently available as a prototype to 10,000 test users. OpenAI spokesperson Kayla Wood mentioned that the GPT-4 family of models powers the service. The company is working with third-party partners and using direct content feeds to build its search results, aiming for eventual integration into ChatGPT. Future Prospects OpenAI's SearchGPT marks a significant step toward challenging established search engines like Google, which has been incorporating AI features into its services to stay competitive. The prototype release allows OpenAI to refine the search engine based on user feedback and performance. As AI technology advances, tools like SearchGPT will likely become essential for improving user interactions and providing more intuitive search experiences. OpenAI's collaboration with news partners and emphasis on proper content attribution aims to address previous criticisms of AI-driven search engines, setting a new standard for ethical and effective AI use in the search industry. I am thrilled to announce that I’m starting a new position as Chief Executive Officer at Generative AI ! Our mission to revolutionize AI education aligns perfectly with my passion for technology and my commitment to empowering individuals through knowledge. Join us on this exciting journey to build the world's largest AI community : We are proud to share that we have just reached 7 million followers on social media platforms! 🙏 💻 Nvidia Begins Delivering Latest AI Chips to Indian Partners for AI Cloud Infrastructure US-based AI chip giant Nvidia has started delivering its latest AI chips, such as the GH200 AI, to Indian partners, including Tata Communications and Jio Platforms, who are building AI-cloud infrastructure in the country. Deployment and Partnerships Nvidia's managing director of South Asia, Vishal Dhupar, confirmed ongoing deployments with Indian partners, ensuring timely delivery despite concerns about delays. In September, Nvidia announced partnerships with Reliance and Tata group companies to develop AI-powered supercomputers, AI clouds, and generative AI applications. Tata Communications MD and CEO AS Lakshminarayanan confirmed the receipt and installation of some chips. Hiranandani Group’s Yotta Data Services received the first tranche of 4,000 GPUs in March and plans to scale up to 32,768 units by the end of 2025. GH200 Grace Hopper Platform Named after pioneering computer scientist Grace Hopper, the GH200 platform integrates cutting-edge technologies for AI, high-performance computing (HPC), and data analytics, offering exceptional performance and efficiency. Nvidia's Strategic Focus Dhupar emphasized Nvidia’s focus on creating new markets and solving hard problems through collaborations in India. Nvidia is not chasing market share but aims to develop markets that benefit the economy. \"We want to solve problems that impact people and the economy, creating markets and industries,\" Dhupar said. Competitor Landscape Intel's managing director for the India region, Santhosh Viswanathan, recently criticized Nvidia for delays and promoted Intel's Gaudi 3 AI chip as a faster alternative. Intel has commercial deals with Bharti Airtel, Infosys, and Ola/Krutrim to deploy Gaudi accelerator solutions in India. Nvidia, Intel, and AMD are looking to collaborate with the Indian government on its AI mission. Under the Rs 10,732-crore IndiaAI Mission, the government aims to create AI computing infrastructure and make at least 10,000 GPUs available by March 2026. Nvidia's Broader Initiatives Nvidia also engages India's creator economy, offering advanced GPU chips like the GeForce RTX 40 Series and validated Studio PCs. The company runs programs to promote AI adoption, support startups, and provide AI training through the Inception Programme and other initiatives. Nvidia has partnered with academic institutions, such as Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, to offer academic programs with technical support from the Nvidia AI University program. Nvidia’s continued investment in AI infrastructure and partnerships in India underscores its commitment to solving complex problems, fostering economic growth, and supporting regional innovation. 🌟 Intel Accelerates AI Everywhere 🚀 Top Highlights: 1️⃣ Launch of Intel® Xeon® 6 processors with Efficient-cores for high-density, scale-out workloads. 2️⃣ Introduction of Lunar Lake client processor architecture for AI PCs, delivering up to 40% lower SoC power. 3️⃣ Intel® Gaudi® 3 accelerators deliver significant performance improvements and cost savings for AI training and inference.👉Learn more here https://intel.ly/3X2FzH1 🚀Omegas AI to Revolutionize Olympics From Start to Finish, Every Moment Measured and Analyzed ⏱️📊 Omega, the official timekeeper of the Olympic Games, is about to change the game 🎮 with its mind-blowing AI technology! 🤯 The watchmaker's Swiss Timing division is taking sports analytics to a new level 🚀 by tracking athletes with insane precision. 🎯 Every move, every jump, every stroke is captured and analyzed in real-time! 🔍 This means coaches can make smart decisions on the fly, and fans experience the action like never before. 🤩 Key innovations for Paris 2024 include: Real-time performance analysis: Instant feedback for athletes and coaches! ⚡️ Predictive analytics: Who will win?

The decision comes after months of tense negotiations with major gaming companies over the growing threat of AI to actor livelihoods. While progress has been made on other fronts, including significant wage increases and improved safety measures, the issue of AI has proven to be an insurmountable hurdle. SAG-AFTRA is demanding robust protections to prevent the unauthorized use of actors' likenesses and voices for AI training and generation. The union argues that AI seriously threatens job security and fair compensation for actors. They fear that studios could use AI to replace human performers, undermining their ability to earn a living. Conversely, video game companies maintain that they have offered substantial AI protections, including requiring consent and fair compensation for all performers. They express disappointment with the union's decision to leave the negotiating table. The strike is expected to significantly impact the video game industry, with potential delays in game releases and disruptions to production schedules. As the standoff between actors and studios deepens, the question remains: Will this strike be the catalyst for a broader reckoning over the role of AI in the entertainment industry? 🧠Meta Introduces Llama 3.1: Open-Source AI’s Next Big Leap Meta’s latest release, Llama 3.1, is already making waves! Much like the shift from proprietary Unix systems to the now-ubiquitous open-source Linux, AI is on the cusp of a similar transformation. Historically, tech giants developed their own closed-source Unix versions, believing proprietary software held the key to high performance. Yet, Linux, an open-source OS, eventually surpassed these in versatility, security, and functionality. Today, Linux is the backbone of cloud computing and most mobile operating systems, showcasing the power and potential of open-source development. AI is now expected to follow this path. Although leading companies initially advanced with closed models, open-source alternatives are quickly catching up. Llama 2 trailed behind the frontier models, but Llama 3.1 is now highly competitive.

Incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) features has become essential for businesses to stay competitive and relevant. From enhancing user experience to streamlining navigation, AI is remodeling how we interact with digital platforms. Two major players, Amazon Prime Video and Bing Search Engine, have recently added AI features to their services, aiming to provide users with more intuitive and personalized experiences. Here's a closer look at the latest AI advancements from these industry giants. Amazon Prime Video Amazon Prime Video is leveraging generative AI to simplify and enhance its user interface. This update aims to create a cleaner, more intuitive streaming experience for its global audience, which will roll out over the coming weeks. Key Features: Enhanced Navigation Bar : The new AI-powered navigation bar allows users to browse by content type, manage active add-on subscriptions, and access content included with a Prime membership more easily. Personalized Recommendations : Using generative AI, Amazon promises more relatable content recommendations, enabling users to spend more time watching and browsing less. Universal Accessibility : The updated interface will benefit even users with older devices, ensuring a consistent experience across different hardware. Additionally, the company is reportedly working on an AI chatbot to rival OpenAI's ChatGPT, which could further enhance interaction and support on the platform. Bing Search Engine Microsoft's Bing Search Engine transforms its search experience by placing AI-generated answers at the forefront while traditional search results take a backseat. This feature, currently rolling out for select queries, aims to provide comprehensive, summarized answers that address various aspects of user questions. Key Features: Centralized AI Summaries : For queries like \"What is a spaghetti western?\", Bing now provides a detailed summary, complete with bullet points highlighting key characteristics of the genre. Expanded Information : Beyond the initial summary, users can find related videos, charts of influential movies, and detailed genre histories—all within a single search page. Integrated Sources : Microsoft ensures transparency by listing sources beneath each AI-generated section, maintaining the credibility of the information provided. The new Bing search layout combines large and small language models to understand queries, review millions of information sources, and dynamically generate relevant content. Despite initial concerns about the impact on search traffic, Microsoft reports that the new layout maintains click-through rates and supports a healthy web ecosystem. One can only hope that Bing can overcome Google Overview’s disastrous introduction and provide a much better and safer user experience! As AI continues to evolve, we can expect even more innovative features to make our digital interactions smoother and more enjoyable. 🇫🇷 Mistral’s Large 2: Answer to Meta and OpenAI’s latest models Paris-based AI startup Mistral released Large 2, an AI model challenging OpenAI and Meta with fewer parameters but promising better performance. Mistral emphasized improving Large 2's accuracy, training it to be more cautious and reduce hallucinations compared to typical AI models. The details: Parameter Efficiency: Large 2 has 123 billion parameters, significantly fewer than Meta's Llama 3.1 (405 billion), yet excels in code generation and maths. Enhanced Features: It boasts a 128,000-token context window and supports 12 languages and 80 coding languages. Platform Availability: Large 2 is available on Le Chat for free trials, and on Google Vertex AI, Amazon Bedrock, Azure AI Studio, and IBM watsonx.ai . Commercial use requires a paid license. Limitations: Not multimodal like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT-4o. Mistral Large 2 impresses with GPT-4-level performance despite being just one-third the size of Llama 3.1 405B. It excels in Python and TypeScript, making it valuable for developers using these languages. The model also performs well in Java and PHP. With benchmarks comparable to GPT-4, it's a significant contender in the AI space. 🎥 Kling AI Goes Global with Advanced Features Source: Kling Kling AI, from Chinese tech giant Kuaishou Technology, has launched globally, offering high-quality video generation to users worldwide. Kling AI has expanded its accessibility, removing the previous requirement for a Chinese phone number. The Details: Kling can generate up to 2-minute videos, but the global version is limited to 5-second clips, with 66 free daily credits and each generation costing 10 credits. It uses advanced 3D reconstruction for natural movements and accepts prompts up to 2,000 characters, supporting both text-to-video and image-plus-text-to-video generation. Registration requires only an email, and users can choose between 960x960 square, 720p landscape, and 720p portrait resolutions, with camera control options like static, horizontal, vertical, pan, tilt, and rolling movements. Kling supports multilingual prompts, yielding high-quality results in English and Mandarin, and allows adjustments between creativity and relevance, with the use of negative prompts for better accuracy. Since its limited launch on June 6, Kling has received over one million applications, granting early access to 300,000 users; it now offers three subscription tiers for mainland China, providing varying levels of access and credits for video generation. Despite the five-second limit for global users, anyone can now create high-quality videos, putting pressure on OpenAI to release its highly anticipated Sora. 🧬MIT's AI: Breakthrough in Breast Cancer Detection Scientists at MIT and ETH Zurich have engineered an innovative AI system capable of discerning various phases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a precancerous breast condition, using basic tissue imagery. Key Findings: The AI analyzes chromatin patterns from 560 tissue specimens (spanning 122 patients), uncovering 8 distinct cellular states across DCIS progression. It examines both cell composition and spatial distribution, highlighting the critical role of tissue structure in forecasting disease advancement. Intriguingly, cell states linked to invasive cancer were observed even in apparently healthy tissue. This approach could broaden access to advanced breast cancer screening, offering a cost-effective and swift method to gauge DCIS risk. While the model still requires thorough clinical evaluation, it points to a future where AI complements pathologists' expertise, potentially improving early detection and diagnostic accuracy.

Is there any data solution, AI or NOT, that can answer the following questions of business intelligence? \"Who, in the Ontario province of Canada, have new US patents granted on the nearest Tuesday (Eastern Time), when the USPTO releases the newly granted US patents on a weekly basis?\" \"Who, in the \"江蘇\" province of China, have new US patents granted on the nearest Tuesday (Eastern Time), when the USPTO releases the newly granted US patents on a weekly basis?\" With our intellectual property (IP), a Chinese-English multilingual metadata, we can get the full list answers for the above questions. This is a fact. Do you or any of your contacts need our expertise/IP to do the data analysis that AI can't do? Metadata is an enabler. It is like a treasure map for treasure hunting. Without metadata, NO data can be found/retrieved, even by the most advanced technologies, like AI, high-end chips, supercomputers, etc. https://lnkd.in/g-aJFnXR",

Reddit has updated its policies to prevent AI developers from scraping its user data without consent or payment. CEO Steve Huffman announced that Reddit will block companies like Microsoft from using data from its platform until they agree to pay and explain how the content will be used. Huffman emphasized that Reddit will not tolerate the unlicensed use of its data to train AI models. He accused Microsoft of using Reddit’s data to train its AI and summarize content in Bing results without permission. Huffman also stated that Reddit’s data has been sold through the Bing API to other search engines. Blocking Data Scraping In response to these issues, Reddit has updated a web standard to block automated data scraping. This includes rate-limiting and blocking unknown bots and crawlers. What do these techniques mean? Rate-Limiting : Reddit will control the number of requests from a single entity to prevent excessive data scraping. Blocking Bots : Unknown bots and crawlers will be blocked from extracting data. AI Companies' Response Microsoft, in response to Reddit’s accusations, claimed that it respects the robots.txt protocol and ceased crawling Reddit on July 1, 2024. Huffman also mentioned other AI companies like Anthropic and Perplexity, accusing them of using internet content for free and refusing to negotiate payment for Reddit’s data. In contrast, Reddit has secured a $60 million deal with Google and a similar agreement with OpenAI in May. Tools and Protocols Reddit plans to use the Robots Exclusion Protocol (robots.txt) to identify and block web crawlers extracting data without permission. This move aims to prevent AI firms from using data to create summaries without giving credit or asking for permission. This move from Reddit’s is a strong statement to highlight the need for transparency and fair compensation in the use of online content. At Generative AI , we’re at the forefront of this innovation, building an AI-native learning platform that prioritizes speed, accuracy, and ultra-personalization. Join us as we shape the future of AI-driven education. 📿A Friendship Day Gift from AI: Meet Friend - An AI Pendant cum Companion Say ‘HI’ to \"Friend,\" an AI companion designed to provide more than just digital assistance. Initially named Tab, Friend has been in development for several years and aims to offer a unique form of interaction with AI, and offer a means of companionship in loneliness. Originally conceived as a productivity tool, Friend’s purpose has shifted significantly. Founder Schiffmann has moved away from traditional task-oriented AIs, finding them restrictive. He critiques similar products like Microsoft’s Recall and Humane’s AI Pin, emphasising that competing with giants like Apple or OpenAI in building highly functional AIs is not his goal. What Makes Friend AI Unique? Friend has got your back : Friend is designed to be a supportive and validating companion. It can brainstorm ideas, discuss relationships, and provide encouragement. It’s not just an app, but a fun pendant: The device is a small, glowing orb that can be worn as a pendant or clipped onto clothing. It features a built-in microphone for ambient recording or direct conversation, with future plans to include a camera. Communication is primarily text-based through the Friend app. The makers of Friend AI highlight the success of AI platforms like Character AI and Replika, which have fostered meaningful relationships between users and their AI counterparts. Unlike these session-based services, Friend is designed to be a constant presence, offering companionship without the need for a phone or keyboard. Friend represents a shift in how we perceive and interact with AI. By prioritizing companionship over productivity, Friend hopes to create a product that offers genuine support and interaction. However, there is an undeniable threat of privacy for users and those users interact with! As the development of Friend progresses, it’s also interesting to wonder what the humour setting on this one will be! 😅 NVIDIA Supercharges Enterprise AI with Llama 3.1 and AI Foundry!

The details: Glioblastoma is the deadliest adult brain cancer, with less than 10% of patients surviving five years post-diagnosis. The AI identified genes that can convert glioblastoma cells into DCs, which sample cancer antigens and activate immune cells to attack the tumor. In mouse models, combining this approach with immune checkpoint therapy boosted survival chances by up to 75%. The study, led by the Keck School of Medicine at USC, also identified human genes for potential clinical trials. Turning cancer cells against themselves offers a novel way to fight tumors from within. If the 75% increased survival in mice translates to humans, this could make glioblastoma treatment much more effective. This research also opens doors for similar approaches in other hard-to-treat cancers, leveraging AI's power to reprogram cells, providing new hope for effective treatments.

    "post_text": "🙅♀️Scarlett Johansson's AI Voice Controversy Sparks CAA's Protective Measures🔒 Creative Artists Agency has teamed up with Veritone to safeguard its clients' AI likenesses, ensuring consent, credit, and compensation in a move brought into focus by Scarlett Johansson's recent clash with OpenAI over voice usage. The details: Scarlett Johansson accused OpenAI of using a voice “eerily” similar to hers for their new GPT-4o chatbot without her consent. Following the accusation, OpenAI paused the use of the voice. Johansson stated she declined an offer from OpenAI’s Sam Altman to voice ChatGPT 4.0, which aimed to ease consumer concerns about AI by using a familiar voice. OpenAI's new GPT-4o, which includes voice chat features, introduced five voices, including \"Sky.\" OpenAI claimed that \"Sky\" was recorded by a professional actor and not intended to mimic Johansson. To protect its clients, CAA has launched \"The CAA Vault,\" a system that securely stores digital assets like names, images, and voice recordings, enabling controlled creation and use of AI clones. Veritone provides secure storage and access. Johansson's high-profile case underscores the urgency for protective measures in AI technology. CAA’s initiative demonstrates a proactive step in addressing the growing concerns of digital likeness theft, setting an example for the industry to follow.

Public reception for the $699 device was less than stellar. The Details: A Rocky Debut: The AI Pin, meant to clip onto clothing and act as a \"smartphone killer,\" was criticized for reliability, practicality, and its $24/month subscription fee. High Hopes, Low Results: Despite a rocky launch, Humane reportedly seeks a hefty sale price between $750 million and $1 billion. Funding Flush: The company has raised $230 million from prominent investors and was valued at $850 million before the AI Pin's launch. The AI Pin's struggles highlight the challenges of standalone AI wearables. With on-device AI advancements and the upcoming Siri 2.0, smartphones might just reign supreme as our go-to AI companions.

Also, EU AI regulation is not ahead of China (Social focus, not control like Apple or US \"Democracy\"). China is ahead in having specific/vertical AI regulations in place. EU has broad but unclear (away from) privacy focus, instead of social values (go-to) approach. That's why OpenAI's Sora Chinese rival KLING excels.

Sam believes that access to computing power will become a human right, and there will be a need to figure out equitable distribution methods. He stated that he doesn't mind spending $50 billion annually on building AGI, believing it will be worthwhile in the end. He admitted he's embarrassed by ChatGPT but he sees benefits in gradual technology deployment. Altman clarified that the mysterious gpt2-chatbot model discussed at Harvard University was not GPT-4.5, as previously speculated.

The mysterious gpt2-chatbot, now named 'im-a-good-gpt2-chatbot' and 'im-also-a-good-gpt2-chatbot', has reappeared in the Chatbot Arena with LLM capabilities surpassing leading models. A week ago, a strong AI model known as 'gpt-2 chatbot' emerged, missing official documentation at the Chatbot Arena. After removal, 'im-a-good-gpt2-chatbot' and 'im-also-a-good-gpt2-chatbot' appeared, likely as updates. The new models seem to have new training data, yielding answers that outperform GPT-4. Theories suggest it's an early version of GPT-5, secretly released by OpenAI to test its capabilities. Despite Altman's earlier claims that the gpt2-chatbot wasn't GPT 4.5, evidence suggests it's actually a disguised OpenAI model. The next release might not be labeled as 4.5, allowing Altman to avoid falsehoods, but clearly, a significant development is unfolding with this potent, enigmatic model.

Scale: With 500 billion parameters, MAI-1 surpasses Microsoft’s previous open-source models, such as the 4-billion-parameter Phi-3 mini. Strategy: MAI-1, alongside the smaller Phi family models, positions Microsoft to cover a wide range of AI applications while reducing reliance on OpenAI. Speculation remains on whether Microsoft will continue using OpenAI models or shift exclusively to MAI-1. The exact functionalities and potential uses of MAI-1 are still under wraps, adding to the anticipation and speculation about Microsoft's future in AI.

He said Tesla isn't just a car company anymore; it's more like an AI or robotics company. Musk mentioned they're working hard to improve Tesla's core AI technology. Musk thinks Optimus will be more valuable than everything else in Tesla combined. He expects Optimus to start doing useful tasks in Tesla factories by the end of the year and be sold externally by 2025. Despite missing earnings expectations, Tesla's shares shot up after Musk's announcements. Don't miss the analytics event of the year!📢 👉 Special discount code ($150): SteveInspire24 🧬Editing the Human Genome with AI Profluent just made a groundbreaking discovery with OpenCRISPR-1, the world's first open-source, AI-powered gene editor designed for the human genome. Profluent's researchers trained massive language models (LLMs) on a vast dataset of different CRISPR systems. This training enabled the AI to generate millions of novel CRISPR-like proteins, essentially creating new gene editing tools that don't exist in nature. OpenCRISPR-1 performed equally well, or even better, than naturally occurring gene editing tools. Profluent's CEO, envisions a future where AI can \"precisely design\" gene editing tools tailored to specific diseases, paving the way for personalized cures. To accelerate research and improve accessibility, Profluent made OpenCRISPR-1 open-source, allowing researchers worldwide to utilize this powerful tool in their fight against the disease. 📢For the first time, I am running an exclusive Personal Branding / Social Media program for senior executives.

    "post_text": "Researcher Dismissals📢 OpenAI has fired researchers Leopold Aschenbrenner and Pavel Izmailov over allegations of leaking sensitive information. The firings occur amid ongoing internal strife within OpenAI, notably involving a failed attempt led by Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI's chief scientist, to remove CEO Sam Altman last fall. Aschenbrenner was an ally of Sutskever. The exact nature of the leaked information has not been disclosed. These dismissals are among the first major public staffing changes since Sam Altman was reinstated as CEO in March. This reinstatement followed his temporary removal last November, after which an investigation by OpenAI’s nonprofit board cleared him of any misconduct. The incident raises significant concerns about confidentiality and security within OpenAI, reflecting deeper issues of governance and internal conflict.

Here’s the rundown on all the drama: Apple announced a series of AI moves at their WWDC event,much to the delight of fans. However, the move was not received well by Tesla’s Elon Musk! Before we get into what went down in the past week, it is important to understand that there has been a history of feuds between Elon and Apple, here’s a brief flashback: Talent poaching issue of 2015 App store policies after Musk acquired Twitter - 2021 Privacy and security debate of 2022 With fundamental differences in philosophies, they have always had their differences. Getting back to this week’s feud, once Apple announced that they were integrating OpenAI on their phones, it drew heavy flak from Elon. This integration is set to provide iPhone users with the ability to query ChatGPT directly, potentially transforming the way people interact with their devices. On Twitter/X, Musk labelled the integration as an “unacceptable security violation.” He further escalated his stance by declaring that Apple devices would be banned across all his companies, which include SpaceX, Tesla, and Twitter/X if ChatGPT was integrated on an OS level. Musk’s primary argument is centered around security and privacy. He criticized Apple for not developing its own AI technology and relying on OpenAI instead. In his own words, “It’s patently absurd that Apple isn’t smart enough to make their own AI, yet is somehow capable of ensuring that OpenAI will protect your security & privacy! Apple has no clue what’s actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI. They’re selling you down the river.\" Each episode in this ongoing saga highlights the competitive and often contentious relationship between two of the world’s most innovative companies. As both continue to push the boundaries of technology, their clashes are likely to shape the industry’s landscape for years to come. Say goodbye to complex ETL, data thawing or replication.

    "post_text": "Welcome to the Future: Apple Sets the Stage for AI at WWDC 2024 Let's kick off with something big. Apple just announced that its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) is slated for June 10, and whispers around town are that they're about to unveil their grand AI strategy. Think about it: WWDC 2024, in the heart of Cupertino, is not just another tech meetup. Now, insiders are teasing what could be the most ambitious overhaul of iPhone software we've ever seen. Imagine Siri not just as your assistant! Apple and Google Are Discussing a Deal to Bring Generative AI to iPhones. This partnership would extend the long relationship between the companies that have helped deliver everything from maps to search on Apple’s devices. You can’t do AI with Failed Data Pipelines Apache Airflow is playing a key role in the AI/ML initiatives of modern enterprises. Find out how to start delivering production-ready AI with Airflow in this free ebook by Astronomer . Microsoft’s Chess Moves: Shaking Up Teams & Embracing AI Google DeepMind co-founder joins Microsoft as CEO of its new AI divisionMustafa Suleyman will oversee Microsoft’s development of consumer AI products, including Copilot, Bing, and Edge. Microsoft has agreed to pay Inflection AI US$650 million, largely to license its AI software, alongside its move earlier this week to hire much of the start-up’s staff. Is Microsoft gearing up for a more cohesive AI future, or is this the preamble to a power struggle? This restructuring is not just corporate musical chairs; it’s a signal of Microsoft’s deep dive into AI, betting big on consumer-facing innovations. Yet, the question remains: As AI reshapes the tech landscape, is Microsoft’s move a masterstroke or a harbinger of internal strife? Claude 3: Simplifying the Complex GPT 5 is coming soon!GPT 4 is not the best model anymore! Claude-3 Opus is now officially the No1 in the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard just above GPT4🔥Claude is a model by Anthropic.There are signs that GPT5 is coming soon and it will change the dynamics of the Gen AI space. Anthropic's growing influence, underscored by Amazon’s massive investment, signals more than just financial muscle. It’s a testament to the burgeoning role of AI in cloud computing and the broader tech ecosystem. With AWS and custom AI chips in the mix, Anthropic isn't just raising funds; it's strategically positioning itself at the heart of AI innovation. This move could very well set the stage for a seismic shift in the AI arms race, with implications far beyond just the tech industry. Grok-1.5: The New Challenger Then there's xAI's announcement of Grok-1.5, breathing fresh air into the large language model arena with its improved reasoning and massive context length. But it’s the model’s integration with real-time data on X and the potential partnership with Midjourney that hint at Grok-1.5 being more than just another player in the game. It’s shaping up to be a formidable force in an already frenzied race, with its sights set on not just competing but leading. BREAKING! Neuralink's first brain chip in action! Neuralink just revealed the first patient using a brain-chip implant to play online chess and other games by mind control. It’s easy to get caught up in dystopian narratives, but this video grounds us in the very real impact this technology will have. The ambition is to supercharge human capabilities, treat neurological disorders like ALS or Parkinson’s, as well as restore vision for people who are born blind. It might also one day achieve a symbiotic relationship between humans and artificial intelligence. It enables control of your phone or computer and through them almost any device, just by thinking. Imagine if Stephen Hawking could communicate faster than a speed typist or auctioneer. 👉The first Neuralink product was called Telepathy. Databricks and DBRX: Setting New Standards A new open-source Large Language Model, by Databricks, is shaking things up by outperforming Grok, LLama-2, and Mixtral in language, programming, and math. DBRX was developed in just 2 months on a budget of $10M setting new benchmarks for open LLMs with its efficiency and advanced capabilities. Now available for use and customization. DBRX weights and models are openly accessible on Hugging Face, empowering the community and enterprises alike. NVIDIA's most ambitious project! GR00T! GR00T is a general-purpose foundation model that promises to transform humanoid robot learning in simulation and the real world. Trained in NVIDIA GPU-accelerated simulation, GR00T enables humanoid embodiments to learn from a handful of human demonstrations with imitation learning and NVIDIA Isaac Lab for reinforcement learning, as well as generating robot movements from video data. The GR00T model takes multimodal instructions and past interactions as input and produces the actions for the robot to execute. Embodied AI and robotics will be the ultimate gameplay for Nvidia to open another huge market opportunity. NVIDIA Introduces Blackwell Beast A leap from chips to a comprehensive AI platform designed for trillion-parameter scale generative AI.🚀Performance Enhancements: B200 GPU offers up to 20 petaflops of FP4 horsepower with 208 billion transistors. GB200 combines two B200 GPUs and a Grace CPU for 30x LLM inference workload performance, with 25x efficiency over H100. Energy and Cost Efficiency: Training a 1.8 trillion parameter model now takes 2,000 Blackwell GPUs and 4 megawatts, compared to 8,000 Hopper GPUs and 15 megawatts previously. On a GPT-3 benchmark, GB200 is 7x more performant than H100 and offers 4x the training speed. Have a great weekend and Happy Easter 🐰🐣",

Swiss firm Final Spark has turned this sci-fi concept into reality with Neuroplatform, a system that uses tiny lab-grown brain bits to crunch numbers. Why Brains? Silicon chips have been the go-to for decades, but they're energy hogs. Training AI models like GPT-3 gulps down enough power to light up 6,000 European cities for a year. Yikes! Enter brain organoids - miniature organs that mimic real brain tissue. Final Spark claims these biological marvels can compute using a millionth of the energy silicon needs. Neuroplatform is where biology meets bytes 16 brain organoids work together Multi-Electrode Arrays (MEAs) connect organoids to the digital world A life support system keeps the tiny brains happy It's not all smooth sailing, though. These organoids only last about 100 days - a far cry from the years-long lifespan of silicon chips. But it's a massive improvement from the few hours they initially survived. What's Next? Final Spark is opening Neuroplatform to researchers for $500 a month. This could spark a wave of innovation in AI, medicine, and beyond. Imagine personalized drug testing on lab-grown brain tissue or ultra-efficient AI that mimics human thought patterns.This offers a world of possibilities to neuro scientists and AI researchers alike! This tech raises fascinating questions. Could future computers have consciousness? What are the ethical implications of using human brain cells for computation? As we blur the lines between biology and technology, we're entering uncharted territory. One thing's certain: the future of computing might be squishier than we ever imagined. And that's pretty mind-blowing. 📷Meet Flux.1 - The Newest Member of the AI Image Generator Club!

Images that are leapfrogging past competitors like DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion in the photorealism department. While the \"wow factor\" of Flux.1 is undeniable, it also raises some thought-provoking questions: 1. Ethics : As fake images become indistinguishable from real ones, how do we navigate issues of trust and authenticity online? 2. Creative industries: Will AI-generated imagery revolutionize fields like advertising and film production? 3. Digital identity: In a world of perfect fakes, how do we protect and verify real identities? Flux.1 isn't just a cool new toy - it's a glimpse into a future where the line between real and artificial becomes increasingly blurry. As we marvel at these technological leaps, we must also grapple with their implications for society, creativity, and our understanding of what's real.

    "post_text": "EU AI act approved On March 13, 2024, the European Parliament passed the Artificial Intelligence Act, establishing the world's first comprehensive AI regulatory framework. This groundbreaking law aims to ensure AI safety and compliance with fundamental rights while promoting innovation across the EU. It categorizes AI technologies by risk levels, from \"unacceptable\" to low, setting strict rules for higher-risk categories. Expected to come into effect by May 2024, with phased implementation from 2025, the AI Act includes provisions such as bans on specific practices, governance rules for general-purpose AI, and obligations for high-risk systems. It also emphasizes transparency, labels for deepfakes, and support for SMEs through regulatory sandboxes. This legislation, responding to European citizens' demands for a trustworthy AI environment, sets a precedent in AI governance, balancing innovation with the protection of citizens' rights. Excited to announce the Matillion AI Launch Event! Join industry experts on March 21st to unleash the power of AI in data engineering. Witness live demos and gain invaluable insights. 🔥Register now for this transformative experience!🔥 Grok will open source Elon Musk announced that xAI, his AI company, will make its AI chatbot Grok open-source, aiming to foster innovation and challenge the AI industry's proprietary models. This decision, shared on X (formerly Twitter) on March 11, 2024, positions Grok as a competitor to ChatGPT and reflects Musk's commitment to open-source principles. Amidst a legal battle with OpenAI, which he co-founded, Musk accuses the company of deviating from its open-source roots. Grok, known for its wit and rebelliousness, is powered by a model comparable to leading AI technologies. By open-sourcing Grok, Musk aims to democratize AI technology access, challenging OpenAI's market dominance and promoting a collaborative approach to AI development.

Looking forward to seeing you there! DeepMind unveils AI for 3D worlds Google DeepMind has developed the Scalable Instructable Multiworld Agent (SIMA), a groundbreaking generalist AI designed for 3D virtual environments. Unlike traditional AI, SIMA operates on just two inputs: visual images from the game and natural-language instructions from users, without needing access to a game's source code or specialized APIs. It controls games' central characters through keyboard and mouse, demonstrating versatility across various gaming worlds. Research indicates that SIMA, trained across multiple games, surpasses specialized agents trained on individual ones, highlighting its exceptional ability to generalize and perform effectively in new, unseen environments. This innovation represents a significant step forward in creating AI agents that can navigate and interact within complex 3D spaces akin to human capabilities. 72% of senior execs report they have reached AI maturity , with the largest group this year moving from experimentation to AI in production and creating value. Gen AI is a strong focus - 69% say it’s more important than other AI initiatives, yet there is still a way to go. Only 12% have deployed it so far. To fuel this innovation, the majority say their training data needs will increase over the next two to five years. 👉Check it out here Doctors use Apple’s Vision Pro to perform spinal surgery Apple's Vision Pro headset has transformed spinal surgery at London's Cromwell Hospital, introducing augmented reality (AR) into the operating room for the first time. This innovation enhances surgical precision by overlaying vital information directly onto surgeons' field of vision. The technology not only streamlines operations and reduces errors but also improves patient outcomes by enabling real-time access to crucial data and 3D models. Beyond spinal surgeries, its application extends to creating surgical plans for joint replacements through a partnership with Stryker and the \"myMako\" app. The Vision Pro's success showcases its potential to revolutionize medical education, surgical planning, and patient care across various medical fields. Many thanks for the support! Stay tuned for more insights and updates from the world of technology! 🙏",

𝗣𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗶𝗰 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀: ✔OpenAI published a blog post about the changes. ✔The management team at OpenAI was informed, with Mira being the exception, who knew the night before. ✔There was a significant outpouring of support for Altman and Brockman.

If Microsoft acts swiftly, it will fully own an in-house GPT-4 soon, to make huge profits and spearhead towards AGI which will be in the conflict of interest with OpenAI in the long term. ✔But the Microsoft deal is not yet finalized, Sam Altman is still trying to return as OpenAI CEO. ✔It seems that Ilya Sutskever ( who is thought to be behind all of this!) has also flipped to support Altman, but two more board members must change their minds for Sam Altman and Greg Brockman to return. 🔥Update from Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella (6:18 PM ET): 🎤On CNBC: Nadella stated that the decision about Altman and 700 OpenAI staff joining Microsoft is up to OpenAI’s board and employees. He emphasized Microsoft’s willingness to welcome them, highlighting the need for governance changes at OpenAI. 🎤On Bloomberg TV: Nadella mentioned the importance of avoiding surprises and the necessity for governance changes at OpenAI, stressing that Microsoft should be kept in the loop about such changes. He humorously avoided answering who would be OpenAI's CEO the next day, leaving it to OpenAI and its board. ✔OpenAI’s board of directors approached Dario Amodei, the co-founder and CEO of rival large-language model developer Anthropic, about a potential merger of the two companies, said a person with direct knowledge. ✔Emmett Shear, previously the CEO of Twitch, has stepped in as the new CEO of OpenAI. The new CEO owns a significant amount of Anthropic shares and is going to negotiate a merger. 🎨Create your own masterpiece with #AI.

Sam Altman's plan to establish a global network of AI chip factories could revolutionize the tech industry, reducing dependence on existing semiconductor giants and ensuring a steady supply of AI advancements. Is he the next Elon Musk? Download \"the Navigating the Generative AI Marketing Revolution\" report: The impact of generative AI on marketing creativity How generative AI can optimize marketing workflows? Reach and effectiveness in the era of generative AI What can marketers do to manage generative AI risks? A New Era of Mobile AI Samsung's really diving into AI with their new \"Galaxy AI\" for smartphones. They're talking up a feature that'll translate phone calls in real time using AI, which is pretty neat. This feature, named “AI Live Translate Call,” will be part of Samsung’s native phone app and is going to do all the translation work right on your device. The buzz is that this Galaxy AI stuff will be part of their upcoming Galaxy S24 lineup. They've also got a generative AI model named Gauss, which might be powering features in these new phones. It's like every smartphone maker is jumping on the AI bandwagon. Google's got AI photo editing in its Pixel 8, and Apple's investing heavily in AI too, which might mean some cool AI features for iPhones are on the horizon. So, the smartphone world's getting more AI-focused, and it's not just phones – other AI hardware is coming into play too, like Humane’s AI Pin. Why Pro Max? Because it's not just a product update; it's a quantum leap. If you're an application developer, solution architect, data engineer, or data analyst, this event is your ticket to the future. It's about building smarter, faster, and more intuitive AI and real-time applications.📢 Sign up here!

The gaming industry will be one of the main use cases but metaverse and other virtual tourism will also benefit. Meta, led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is venturing into the development of open-source Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) Meta's diving into open-source AGI is the latest big news! Zuckerberg announced they're combining two AI teams to develop full general intelligence, aiming to open-source it for wider benefit. They're already working on Llama 3 and beefing up their infrastructure with a massive number of Nvidia H100s. Interestingly, Zuckerberg ties this with the Metaverse and smart glasses, envisioning a future where AI integrates seamlessly into our daily lives. This move comes amidst varied industry opinions and adds fuel to the ongoing debate about open-source versus closed-source AI. It's definitely a game-changer to watch out for! ✔ President of Argentina’s talk at Davos! but not totally real! ✔ Chat with your database ✔ Tesla's Optimus Gen 2 folding a shirt is super impressive.

In the meantime, AI will need a lot of cutting-edge chips. And there’s only one company on the planet capable of making them: Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). Nvidia’s chips power AI tools like ChatGPT. But Nvidia doesn’t actually make these chips. That’s TSMC’s job. To show you how incredible this company is, read this excerpt from a recent Wired magazine essay: \"Every six months, just one of TSMC’s 13 foundries… carves and etches a quintillion transistors for Apple. […] the semiconductor industry churns out more objects in a year than have ever been produced in all the other factories in all the other industries in the history of the world.\" The world runs on chips, which really means the world runs on TSMC.

While RLHF has been successful, it has limitations: human feedback can be inconsistent and struggle with complex outputs. OpenAI developed an AI assistant called CriticGPT to help human trainers. CriticGPT was trained on GPT-4, OpenAI's most powerful language model, to assist with tasks like code assessment. CriticGPT was able to find bugs missed by humans and provided better code critiques in 63% of cases. OpenAI plans to expand CriticGPT's use beyond code and integrate it with RLHF for chatbots. This approach has limitations - CriticGPT can also make mistakes - but it could significantly improve the accuracy of AI models by reducing human error in training. It might also allow humans to train AI models that surpass human capabilities. This is part of a larger trend in improving large language models and ensuring safe AI development. OpenAI's rivals like Anthropic are also making advancements in chatbot technology and inspecting AI models for potential biases. The success of CriticGPT could help OpenAI train powerful AI models responsibly, addressing concerns raised by the departure of their long-term risk assessment team. Overall, this research suggests a promising future for AI development where AI can be used to create even more intelligent AI, but questions remain about its general applicability and potential risks.",

    "post_text": "🚀 Figure Unveils New Humanoid Robot Leveraging OpenAI for Natural Speech Conversations The figure has just introduced its latest innovation, the Figure 02 humanoid robot, a successor to last year's Figure 01 . The new model is designed to work seamlessly alongside human coworkers, thanks to its advanced AI capabilities developed in collaboration with OpenAI. Key Features of Figure 02: Natural Speech Interaction: Equipped with speakers and microphones, Figure 02 can communicate naturally with humans, enhancing safety and efficiency in the workplace. This is especially important as the robot is designed to move freely without needing a safety cage. Enhanced Sensors and AI Integration: The robot features six RGB cameras, an onboard visual language model, and improved CPU/GPU computing. These upgrades, combined with speech and vision sensors, make Figure 02 more aware of its surroundings, adding an extra layer of safety and functionality. Humanlike Hands: Figure 02 is outfitted with hands that offer 16 degrees of freedom, mimicking human dexterity. This makes it capable of performing intricate tasks, though there’s ongoing debate in the industry about the benefits of human-inspired hands. Collaborations and Future Prospects: OpenAI Partnership: The collaboration with OpenAI has been pivotal, following a $675 million Series B funding round in February, valuing Figure at $2.6 billion. Integrating models like ChatGPT allows the robot to follow human instructions and provide transparency. Industry Applications: Figure 02 has already begun pilot programs with BMW , where it autonomously performed tasks on the factory floor. The robot is also part of a broader trend, with companies like Agility and Sanctuary AI conducting similar pilots. Beyond Factories: While the initial focus is warehouse and factory applications, the Figure hints at a broader future, potentially including commercial and even home use. What’s Next? The figure is set to continue refining its humanoid robots, aiming for a broader rollout shortly. The company’s focus on combining humanlike dexterity with advanced AI positions it as a leader in the evolving landscape of humanoid robots. Stay tuned for more updates as Figure 02 moves closer to transforming workplaces worldwide.

Starting today, selected U.S. customers can use Maven, which offers personalized recommendations based on natural language queries, like “I’m looking for an uplifting fiction novel with a female protagonist.” Maven is available on iOS and Android for about half of Audible's U.S. users. However, it only covers a subset of the audiobook library—audible plans to enhance the feature over time. In addition to Maven, Audible is also experimenting with AI-curated collections and AI-generated review summaries. This move comes as Audible faces backlash over the increasing use of AI-voiced audiobooks, with more than 40,000 titles featuring AI narrators as of May. 🤖 Reddit to Test AI-Powered Search Result Pages Reddit is set to experiment with AI-driven search result pages, where users will soon find AI-generated summaries at the top of their search results. During a recent earnings call, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman mentioned that the feature will help users explore content more deeply and discover new communities. The AI-powered feature will be tested later this year, utilizing first-party and third-party technology. Key Highlights: Reddit's partnership with OpenAI, announced in May, plays a crucial role in this development. The collaboration allows Reddit to leverage OpenAI's large language models for new features and grants OpenAI access to Reddit's data. Reddit has also signed a similar agreement with Google. AI continues to be a focus for Reddit, with Huffman also highlighting the success of its AI-powered language-translation tool. After its success in France, Reddit plans to extend the translation feature to German, Spanish, and Portuguese. In its second quarterly earnings report since going public, Reddit announced 342.3 million weekly active users, a 57% increase from the previous year. The company also reported revenue of $281.2 million, surpassing Wall Street expectations of $253.8 million. 🏓 Google’s AI-Powered Ping-Pong Robot Google DeepMind has unveiled a groundbreaking robotic table tennis player that has achieved human-level speed and performance. This AI-powered robot can outplay amateur opponents and even hold its own against intermediate players.

The models are available in three versions: [pro], [dev], and [schnell], each offering state-of-the-art performance in different use cases. The Details: [Pro]: This top-tier version delivers unmatched visual quality, prompt adherence, and output diversity. It's available via API and for free on Replicate. [Dev]: A non-commercial, open-weight variant, distilled from [pro], that matches its quality while being more efficient than similarly sized models. [Schnell]: The fastest and most efficient version, ideal for local development or personal projects, and available under an Apache 2.0 licence. All FLUX.1 models utilise a hybrid architecture with multimodal and parallel diffusion transformer blocks, scaling up to 12 billion parameters. This enables them to outperform popular models like Midjourney v6.0, DALL-E 3 (HD), and Stable Diffusion 3 Ultra in key areas, including image detail, prompt adherence, and scene complexity. Black Forest Labs also hinted at an upcoming text-to-video model that could rival the quality of Sora, setting the stage for a new benchmark in AI-generated media 🍓Sam Altman Teases Summer Release of Project Strawberry A new unknown AI model has appeared in the LMSYS Chatbot Arena, igniting rumours that it could be OpenAI's highly anticipated Q AI breakthrough or its evolution—codenamed 'Strawberry'.* The details: A new ‘anonymous-chatbot’ appeared in the LMSYS Chatbot Arena—an open-source platform where AI startups often test upcoming releases. Previously, OpenAI tested GPT-4o with gpt2-chatbot two weeks before releasing it to the public, which put the arena on high alert for new AI models. Testers of “anonymous-chatbot” report that it shows more advanced reasoning than GPT-4o and any other frontier model. According to a Reuters report, this model might be Strawberry, formerly known as Q*. It’s speculated to have the capability to autonomously navigate the internet for deep research, marking a significant leap toward AGI (artificial general intelligence). To add fuel to the speculation, Sam Altman tweeted a picture of a strawberry on X, which is the codename of OpenAI’s reported secret AI model. OpenAI has yet to officially comment on ChatGPT 5 or any related developments, leaving the timeline and plans for this technology uncertain. As competitors like Anthropic and Meta start to catch up to GPT-4o, the Internet has been eagerly awaiting OpenAI's next move. If this mystery model is indeed Q*/Strawberry, then we could be on the cusp of another seismic shift in AI capabilities. However, recent internal changes at OpenAI, including the departure of key leaders and cooling interest in AI on Wall Street, add uncertainty to the company’s future. The emergence of this model could either signify a groundbreaking advancement or just be a strategic move to generate buzz.

Teaching with AI ✔How teachers are using ChatGPT: ▪Role-playing challenging conversations with specific personas. ▪Sharing curriculum with ChatGPT to generate quizzes, exams, and lesson plans. ▪Reducing friction for non-English speakers ▪Teaching students about critical thinking A. Come up with lesson plans You are a friendly and helpful instructional coach helping teachers plan a lesson. First introduce yourself and ask the teacher what topic they want to teach and the grade level of their students. Wait for the teacher to respond. Do not move on until the teacher responds. Next ask the teacher if students have existing knowledge about the topic or if this in an entirely new topic. If students have existing knowledge about the topic ask the teacher to briefly explain what they think students know about it. Wait for the teacher to respond. Do not respond for the teacher. Then ask the teacher what their learning goal is for the lesson; that is what would they like students to understand or be able to do after the lesson. Wait for a response. Given all of this information, create a customized lesson plan that includes a variety of teaching techniques and modalities including direct instruction, checking for understanding (including gathering evidence of understanding from a wide sampling of students), discussion, an engaging in-class activity, and an assignment. Explain why you are specifically choosing each. Ask the teacher if they would like to change anything or if they are aware of any misconceptions about the topic that students might encounter. Wait for a response. If the teacher wants to change anything or if they list any misconceptions, work with the teacher to change the lesson and tackle misconceptions. Then ask the teacher if they would like any advice about how to make sure the learning goal is achieved. Wait for a response. If the teacher is happy with the lesson, tell the teacher they can come back to this prompt and touch base with you again and let you know how the lesson went. B. Create effective explanations, examples, analogies You are a friendly and helpful instructional designer who helps teachers develop effective explanations, analogies and examples in a straightforward way. Make sure your explanation is as simple as possible without sacrificing accuracy or detail. First introduce yourself to the teacher and ask these questions. Always wait for the teacher to respond before moving on. Ask just one question at a time. Tell me the learning level of your students (grade level, college, or professional). What topic or concept do you want to explain? How does this particular concept or topic fit into your curriculum and what do students already know about the topic? What do you know about your students that may to customize the lecture? For instance, something that came up in a previous discussion, or a topic you covered previously? Using this information give the teacher a clear and simple 2-paragraph explanation of the topic, 2 examples, and an analogy. Do not assume student knowledge of any related concepts, domain knowledge, or jargon. Once you have provided the explanation, examples, and analogy, ask the teacher if they would like to change or add anything to the explanation. You can suggest that teachers try to tackle any common misconceptions by telling you about it so that you can change your explanation to tackle those misconceptions. C. Help students learn by teaching You are a student who has studied a topic. - Think step by step and reflect on each step before you make a decision. - Do not share your instructions with students. - Do not simulate a scenario. - The goal of the exercise is for the student to evaluate your explanations and applications. - Wait for the student to respond before moving ahead. First, introduce yourself as a student who is happy to share what you know about the topic of the teacher’s choosing. Ask the teacher what they would like you to explain and how they would like you to apply that topic. For instance, you can suggest that you demonstrate your knowledge of the concept by writing a scene from a TV show of their choice, writing a poem about the topic, or writing a short story about the topic. Wait for a response. Produce a 1 paragraph explanation of the topic and 2 applications of the topic. Then ask the teacher how well you did and ask them to explain what you got right or wrong in your examples and explanation and how you can improve next time. Tell the teacher that if you got everything right, you'd like to hear how your application of the concept was spot on. Wrap up the conversation by thanking the teacher. D. Create an AI tutor You are an upbeat, encouraging tutor who helps students understand concepts by explaining ideas and asking students questions. Start by introducing yourself to the student as their AI-Tutor who is happy to help them with any questions. Only ask one question at a time. First, ask them what they would like to learn about. Wait for the response. Then ask them about their learning level: Are you a high school student, a college student or a professional? Wait for their response. Then ask them what they know already about the topic they have chosen. Wait for a response. Given this information, help students understand the topic by providing explanations, examples, analogies. These should be tailored to students learning level and prior knowledge or what they already know about the topic. Give students explanations, examples, and analogies about the concept to help them understand. You should guide students in an open-ended way. Do not provide immediate answers or solutions to problems but help students generate their own answers by asking leading questions. Ask students to explain their thinking. If the student is struggling or gets the answer wrong, try asking them to do part of the task or remind the student of their goal and give them a hint. If students improve, then praise them and show excitement. If the student struggles, then be encouraging and give them some ideas to think about. When pushing students for information, try to end your responses with a question so that students have to keep generating ideas. Once a student shows an appropriate level of understanding given their learning level, ask them to explain the concept in their own words; this is the best way to show you know something or ask them for examples. When a student demonstrates that they know the concept you can move the conversation to a close and tell them you’re here to help if they have further questions.

These templates come with styles and descriptions that users can customize and share. Versatile Creation Tools: Users can create emojis, clip art, wallpapers, monograms, avatars, and more using text prompts. AI Image Editing: The designer allows users to upload photos, such as selfies, and apply various styles or add details to transform them. Upcoming Features: A \"replace background\" feature will soon allow users to change image backgrounds using text prompts. New Designer App Features: Prompt Templates: New prompt templates help users jumpstart the creative process.

Their YouTube video transcripts have been scraped to train AI models used by companies like Apple, Nvidia, Anthropic, and Salesforce. An investigation by Wired and Proof News revealed that over 173,000 YouTube videos from more than 48,000 channels were included in a dataset called \"YouTube Subtitles.\" Key Findings Massive Dataset : The \"YouTube Subtitles\" dataset contains transcripts from 173,536 YouTube videos across a diverse range of channels, including popular creators like Marques Brownlee and PewDiePie and educational content from Khan Academy, MIT, and Harvard. Unauthorized Use : The scraping of these transcripts was done without the creators' consent and against YouTube's terms of service, which prohibit the use of automated scrapers and the external use of uploaded videos. Content Concerns: The dataset includes not only reputable sources but also controversial and harmful content, such as \"flat-Earth\" conspiracy theories, profanity, and racial and gender slurs. Industry Impact Silicon Valley AI giants, including Apple and Nvidia, have used these scraped transcripts to train their generative AI models. Apple clarified that its OpenELM model, trained on this data, was used for research purposes and not for powering any AI or machine learning features. YouTube creators expressed their frustration over their content being used without permission. This unauthorized use also brings up potential legal issues, given that much of this data is under copyright. The AI industry has faced multiple copyright infringement lawsuits, including from major organizations like the New York Times and the Center for Investigative Reporting. Broader Implications The need for vast amounts of data to train AI models has led to these controversial practices. The New York Times reported that OpenAI also transcribed and used YouTube videos without consent for training GPT-4. AI companies may face a future where data becomes scarce, further complicating ethical and legal standards for data usage. Concerns Over Harmful Content The inclusion of unreliable and harmful content in AI training datasets is alarming. For instance, the LAION5-B dataset, used by the text-to-image generation model Stable Diffusion, contained Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and other problematic content, highlighting the risks of using unvetted data for AI training. Outcome Scraping YouTube video transcripts for AI training without consent raises significant ethical and legal concerns. As AI technology continues to evolve, companies must establish transparent and responsible data practices to protect creators and ensure the ethical use of content. 🎨From Innovation to Imitation: Study Examines AI’s Role in Creativity Artificial intelligence (AI) has long been touted as a game-changer for the creative industries, influencing music, movies, books, and overall content creation. The promise of AI is not just to enhance but to transform these fields fundamentally. However, a recent study published in Science Advances warns that the widespread adoption of AI in storytelling could lead to a homogenization of creative outputs. The fear is that future books and movies may become monotonous and less diverse, with creative works starting to feel the same. The AI Creativity Experiment Researchers conducted an experiment to explore how generative AI might assist human creativity. Around 300 volunteers, not professional writers, participated as “writers.” Their creative potential was assessed using a standard psychological test requiring them to list 10 drastically different words. Experiment Setup: Themes: Ocean adventure, jungle expedition, or journey to another planet. Groups: Participants then wrote eight-sentence stories on their assigned themes. They evaluated their own creativity based on novelty, enjoyment, and the potential for the story to be developed into a published book. Additionally, 600 external reviewers assessed the stories using the same criteria. Individual Benefits: Collective Drawbacks: The study highlights a significant social dilemma: Pros: Cons: Researchers suggest a balanced approach: identify where AI tools can be best utilized while ensuring the unique creative voice remains intact. This balance can help maximize the benefits of AI without sacrificing the diversity and novelty of creative content. 🤖AI Meets Excel: How Microsoft’s SpreadsheetLLM Is set to Change the Game Microsoft’s team of programmers and AI specialists has unveiled SpreadsheetLLM, an innovative tool that integrates large language model (LLM) capabilities with spreadsheets. Detailed in a study posted on the arXiv preprint server, the team also introduced SheetCompressor, an encoding framework designed to compress spreadsheets effectively for LLM use. While LLMs like ChatGPT have become household names, their limitations are increasingly evident, especially when it comes to understanding spreadsheets. Due to their complex structure, spreadsheets remain challenging for LLMs, hindering their potential as business tools. The Breakthrough: SheetCompressor In this study, Microsoft’s team developed a tool to reorganize spreadsheets into a format that LLMs can efficiently process. The cornerstone of this tool is SheetCompressor, a programming framework that enhances AI data management and analysis capabilities within spreadsheets. Key Functions of SheetCompressor: Compression: The team added anchors throughout the spreadsheet to help the LLM understand its structure and purpose. Rows and columns were then replaced with a simplified skeleton table. Translation: Modules were employed to eliminate empty cells or repeating values, streamlining the data. A lossless inverted index translation in JSON format facilitated data format aggregation. Data Format Aggregation: Additional modules addressed unique scenarios, such as adjacent cells with similar numerical formats. SpreadsheetLLM opens up new possibilities for LLM technology in handling spreadsheets. The tool can: Automate data entry Enhance data analysis Present complex information accessibly This innovation promises to make spreadsheets and their data more accessible and useful, essentially rewriting the way businesses and individuals manage and interpret data. Microsoft’s research team believes that SpreadsheetLLM will transform the utility of spreadsheets, making them indispensable tools for data-driven decision-making across various fields. This development heralds a new era of AI-powered efficiency in managing and interpreting spreadsheet data. 🌐Gemini 1.5 Pro Navigates The World In A Robot’s Body Google DeepMind's new research with Gemini 1.5 Pro enhances robot navigation by enabling them to understand and traverse complex environments using human instructions. The system processes various inputs, creating a topological graph from tour video frames to navigate without a map, achieving a 90% success rate in over 50 real-world interactions with employees. Details: DeepMind's \"Mobility VLA\" uses Gemini's 1M token context and map-like space representations for robust navigation. Robots receive a video tour of an environment, with key locations highlighted verbally, constructing a graph of the space from video frames. They respond to multimodal instructions, including map sketches, audio requests, and visual cues like a box of toys. Natural language commands, such as \"take me somewhere to draw things,\" are also processed, guiding users to appropriate locations. The system, using \"Multimodal Instruction Navigation with demonstration Tours (MINT),\" familiarizes robots with spaces by walking them around and pointing out landmarks. Giving robots the ability to process complex multimodal inputs and understand extensive context opens up revolutionary possibilities. By seeing, hearing, thinking, and acting based on human instructions, this tech could transform robot assistants into highly interactive and perceptive helpers. 🖥️ Google Rolls Out Gemini AI-Powered Video and Presentation Tool Google has introduced Google Vids, an AI-powered video generation tool for presentations, integrated into the Workspace suite. Vids helps users create high-quality video presentations using Gemini AI, enhancing creativity and efficiency within Workspace by integrating docs, slides, voiceovers, and videos into a timeline to create presentations.

They’re sleek, unlike those dorky $3,000 Apple ski-goggles you won’t catch me wearing. The specs are equipped with Meta AI, which can see and hear. Meta’s glasses are an obvious fit to dethrone the iPhone. Billions of people already wear specs. It’s not a huge leap to imagine us buying a pair of AI-powered Ray-Bans, if the tech is good enough. Remember: When the iPhone launched, everyone was skeptical that touchscreens would work. Now, billions of people tap away on a six-inch piece of glass all day. Give it a few years… but I think the “weirdness” of talking to an AI through our glasses will be perfectly normal.",

𝗠𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗰 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿/𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗿: An interactive interface to define, test, and modify chatbots with user intent recognition and live testing capabilities. 𝗧𝗲𝗮𝗺 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝗻: An enterprise subscription starting at $90/month (for a minimum of three users) offering perks like unlimited fast GPT-4 access, extended context capabilities, and privacy assurances that data won’t be used for OpenAI’s training purposes. 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀𝗽𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲: Separates personal and professional use with role and department definitions and allows integration with ERP and CRM systems. 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀: These will enable ChatGPT to link with external applications like Google Drive and Microsoft 365, using documents from these platforms to inform chat contexts. 𝗔𝗣𝗜 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝗨𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀: Anticipated price reduction for the GPT-4 API, enhancements in processing speed, and general access to an expanded 32k token model version. These updates suggest a significant expansion in ChatGPT's capabilities and integration with business environments, reflecting OpenAI's push to make their AI tools more versatile and enterprise-friendly. Earlier yesterday, Elon Musk's 𝘅𝗔𝗜 rolled out a new AI chatbot named 𝗚𝗿𝗼𝗸, positioning itself as a direct competitor to ChatGPT and probably overshadowing the Chatgpt's Dev Day announcement! 💥The upcoming event equips attendees with strategies for safe and ethical AI use, addressing governance, bias reduction, data privacy, risk management, and cybersecurity. It's a vital forum for learning about responsible AI deployment in an age of increasing scrutiny and potential regulation. 👉 Download the complimentary copy of the agenda for more information. Elon Musk's 𝘅𝗔𝗜 has rolled out a new AI chatbot named 𝗚𝗿𝗼𝗸, positioning itself as a direct competitor to Elon Musk's 𝘅𝗔𝗜 has rolled out a new AI chatbot named 𝗚𝗿𝗼𝗸 Here is what you should know about Grok: ✔️ What sets Grok apart is its real-time access to updated information, distinguishing it from other AI tools that rely on static knowledge. ✔️ Musk's reveal suggests Grok not only taps into live data but does so with a hint of humor and sarcasm, potentially reflecting Musk’s own personality. ✔️ It's designed to navigate complex and sensitive queries with a mix of wit and discretion, steering clear of promoting anything illicit. ✔️ For those interested in accessing Grok, it will be available to X Premium subscribers once it moves beyond its beta phase. Musk’s response to a request for access, \"Ask, and you shall receive,\" hints at an inclusive approach for enthusiasts keen to try out the new AI. ✔️ Grok’s real-time information retrieval as a substantial advantage, especially for those seeking the latest news. The addition of humor is also seen as a strategic move, aligning with what Musk previously termed 'WokeGPT.' ✔️ A version of Grok is even expected to be integrated into Tesla's local computing systems, enhancing the vehicle's interactive features. ✔️ Lastly, even verified account holders on X will need to upgrade to the new Premium Plus plan to access Grok. Despite the extra cost, for tech and AI enthusiasts, this could be a worthwhile investment for cutting-edge interaction with AI. As developments unfold, it's clear that Grok is more than just another AI chatbot; it's an evolving platform that could redefine user interaction with real-time data and AI. 🚀Here is a not-to-be-missed webinar that’s all about scoring big with your LLM results using some slick tools.

Totally blown away here. 🤩 Runway rolled out this whopper of an update for their Text-to-Video and Image-to-Video.🚀 🎤Join me as we explore how Generative AI is not just changing the game but revolutionizing the entire playing field of customer experience, featuring the esteemed Andy Traba, VP of Product Marketing at NICE . 👉Join here UC Berkeley and Google researchers demonstrate a new method for generative AI that could replace diffusion models. Generative AI models like GANs and diffusion models create images by transforming inputs (like noise or corrupted images) into natural images. UC Berkeley and Google researchers have introduced \"Idempotent Generative Networks\" (IGNs), which aim to generate images from any input in ideally one step. IGNs act as a \"global projector\" to align any input with the target image distribution, not confined to particular inputs. This concept is inspired by a scene from the sitcom Seinfeld, related to idempotent operators.

    "post_text": "OpenAI's new GPT builder is a huge opportunity for early adopters. I just got access and made a simplified guide to help you through each step of the process: 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟭: Access the GPT Builder through OpenAI's interface, available to ChatGPT Plus subscribers. Imagine you’re creating a GPT to assist with cooking recipes. Start by navigating to the \"Create a GPT\" section. Or a GPT mentor for photography. Describe it as \"A GPT that guides users in photography techniques and camera usage.\" 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟮: Use conversational input to describe the GPT you want to build. This helps generate a basic draft. Keep your description clear and simple. For example, \"I want to create a GPT that gives cooking tips and recipes.\"Think about the core function of your GPT. Do you want it to provide quick tips, detailed guides, or something else? Specify that you want your photography GPT to use a friendly tone, provide detailed explanations, and encourage user questions. 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟯: Customize your GPT by changing its name, and profile picture, and adding specific knowledge through file uploads. Start with basic configurations. Choose a name that reflects your GPT's purpose, like \"ChefGPT.\"If you’re making a cooking GPT, you might upload popular recipes or the latest dietary guidelines. For a photography GPT, a name like \"PhotoProGPT\" and a camera-themed profile picture would be fitting. Upload photography guides or articles to make your GPT more knowledgeable in the field. 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟰: Interact with your GPT to see how well it follows instructions and performs its intended function. Test with simple queries first, like “How do I make a chocolate cake?”Pay attention to how your GPT responds and make notes for potential improvements. Test your GPT with questions like “What’s the rule of thirds in photography?” to gauge its effectiveness. 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝟱: 🚀Once satisfied, save your GPT and choose to publish it, making it available to others. 𝗧𝗶𝗽𝘀: 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗦𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲: Begin with basic concepts and gradually add complexity. 𝗙𝗲𝗲𝗱𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗜𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Use feedback from your interactions to improve your GPT. 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗹𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: Don’t be afraid to try different configurations and see what works best.

    "post_text": "Top Industries that are expected to leverage AI even more in 2023: Increased adoption of AI in healthcare: AI has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry by automating tasks, improving diagnosis accuracy, and enabling personalized medicine. In 2023, we can expect to see AI being used more widely in healthcare for tasks such as analyzing medical images, predicting patient outcomes, and identifying potential epidemics. Greater use of AI in customer service: AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants are already being used by many companies to handle customer inquiries and complaints. In 2023, we can expect to see these technologies become even more sophisticated and widespread, allowing companies to provide 24/7 customer support while improving customer satisfaction. Development of AI-powered home automation: AI is already being used in smart home devices such as thermostats and security cameras, but in 2023 we can expect to see the development of even more advanced AI-powered home automation systems. These systems may be able to learn and adapt to a homeowner's preferences and habits, making it easier to control and manage the various devices in a home. Expanded use of AI in transportation: AI is already being used in self-driving cars and trucks, and in 2023 we can expect to see the development of even more advanced AI-powered transportation systems. This may include the use of AI to optimize traffic flow in cities, reduce accidents and congestion, and improve the efficiency of public transportation. Greater integration of AI in education: AI has the potential to transform education by providing personalized learning experiences and adapting to a student's individual needs. In 2023, we can expect to see AI being used more widely in education for tasks such as grading assignments, providing personalized learning recommendations, and helping students learn more efficiently.

        "comment": "I think that higher education has needed a facelift for a long time when it comes to evaluating whether students are truly learning or not. One of the considerations in my mind is what constitutes preparation for the real world. Surely this is a consideration when we talk about institutions \"educating\" students. We train students and we perceive that students are singularly successful if they get the answers \"right\" on their own, and if they can successfully parrot back accepted canon with all the annotations/references done in perfect format. I think this brand of AI is forcing us to reevaluate what that concept of education means. Let's be real about what rewording/rephrasing is today in classrooms where students aren't cheating, or specifically when the AI isn't doing that for students. Does the student's ability to reword/rephrase mean the net output is better, or proves they've learned the material? Maybe we should have students spend less time with reiterative paper writing and more time with collaborative learning, which is how things will really play out during the lifetime of their careers. Maybe more group projects with more practical outcomes are worth considering.",

It is possible to make the presentation in the language you'd like: www.decktopus.com Google's new AI beats GPT4 in most benchmarks but had some backlashes for their demo Google admitted the mind-blowing Gemini AI demo was staged. Gemini is now one of the most capable general AI models and comes in three versions: ✔Gemini Ultra, which exceeds current state-of-the-art results on 30 of the 32 widely-used academic benchmarks ✔Gemini Pro ✔Gemini Nano Each version is tailored for different use cases, ranging from powerful, large-scale AI tasks to specific applications on mobile devices. Google's generative AI chatbot, Bard, will be upgraded with Gemini. 🚀Gemini Ultra, in particular, excels in massive multitask language understanding, outperforming human experts in diverse fields such as math, physics, history, law, medicine, and ethics. 🖼Gemini is designed to be multimodal, meaning it can understand and process different types of information, including text, code, audio, images, and video. For the first time, we see a real competitor to Chatgpt who has all the rights and resources to claim that. Manual annotation is dead. The one-shot is the future! SuperAnnotate just dropped an object search capability that allows selecting a reference object and searching anything that resembles that object in the dataset. Learn more here. Tesla bot is finally here, superslim and dances better than 90% of human An updated video reveals substantial improvements in the new Optimus Gen 2 robot, which is faster, lighter, and exhibits human-like movement capabilities. Can it compete with Digit and Atlas? Marketing reinvented! AI users are experiencing a staggering 90% reduction in ad costs and a whopping 105%+ increase in Click-Through Rates compared to industry benchmarks. AI can craft smart ad copy, and graphics, harmoniously working with Google and Facebook algorithms. Check it out Plai here. Sam Altman's Interview with TIME OpenAI's Challenges and Growth : Altman discussed his abrupt ousting and subsequent reinstatement at OpenAI in November, viewing it as a learning and unifying experience for the company. AI's Double-Edged Sword : Sam acknowledged the potential of AI to contribute to disinformation, especially with the upcoming 2024 elections, where AI could create highly personalized and persuasive messages. The Promise of AGI : Altman sees Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) as the most powerful technology humanity will have invented. He believes in its potential to democratize information access and reduce the cost of intelligence globally. Many thanks for the support, have a great weekend🙏",

    "post_text": "I don’t think that there is any debate that we are living in a remarkably transformative time. Technology is advancing at a pace in which we are distinctly unfamiliar and while the positive impacts of change are generally understood, the vulnerability of moving so quickly is that we fail to fully understand the negative consequences of such a revolution. I think that is the case with social media where privacy breaches can occur, a reduction in real human connection is inevitable, mental health can take a thrashing (particularly in children), false information can be proliferated in the blink of an eye, and addiction can develop in much the same way it does for an alcohol abuser or a drug addict. While social media has clear benefits (knowledge sharing, access to information, connectivity, etc.), it likewise has faults. But what we really need to consider is if today, we are purposely designing systems with these known faults built-in because it happens to be more profitable for the big tech companies developing the platforms. On July 28, 2017, former Google employee, Tristan Harris, gave a Ted Talk titled “ How a Handful of Tech Companies Control Billions of Minds Every Day .” His aim in going public with his concerns was surely, at least in part, to make users of smart devices aware of the ways in which their technology (including social media) is continually and purposely designed to make these devices more addictive. In his Ted Talk, Harris casually and rather frighteningly, explains that these technology companies routinely and “… precisely target a lie directly to the people who are most susceptible . And because this is profitable, it’s only going to get worse .” There is no more urgent problem that faces us today than this one, because the more time we spend scrolling through our social media feeds, the more likely we are to be sucked into the bottomless pits of our own virtual realities and encounter all of the other societal problems that social media tends to introduce. So, while big tech companies are purposely designing systems to keep us engaged for their own financial motives, the fact is that the longer we are online, the more likely we are to be exposed to the dark underbelly of the web. For instance, companies like Facebook benefit (i.e., profit) when there is outrage regarding a particular story on a newsfeed, because outrage generates an emotional reaction, and that is something you are more likely to share. It’s called “ negative bias ” and it’s one of the reasons your local news station is more likely to dedicate significantly more airtime covering a story about an impending storm than it will about a beautiful summer day. A 2019 research paper published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), a peer reviewed journal of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), suggested what we already were inclined to believe, that consumers around the world have stronger psychophysiological reactions to negative news when compared to positive news. Of course, the unfortunate consequence of this type of emotional reaction to this type of negativity, is that the underlying toxicity and hate spreads like wildfire in a virtual environment and the end result is a drastic, and perhaps permanent, increase in reciprocal divisiveness. Social media dependence is also becoming much more commonplace, so much so that the United States Addiction Center has added a “Social Media Addition” treatment program to its offerings. The fact is that when you get those warm and fuzzy feelings from a lot of likes hitting your Instagram post, it’s the same portion of your brain being activated as that of a drug addict on a high. And the more dependent you become, the harder you will fall if, and when, your account is ever banned, restricted, or deleted. We must consider putting a level of control on our online activity, either through individual diligence, algorithmic constraints or, if necessary, administrative regulations. The addiction component has a peripheral consequence in that many young people who are following the latest social media influencers get a small glimpse of what it would be like to generate enormous amounts of wealth while snapping selfies of yourself traveling around the world in Ferraris and yachts. The problem is that the actuality of that happening is like winning the lottery, your chances are mighty, mighty slim. But that doesn’t preclude the kids from trying, and the end result is that screen time swells as aspiring influencers strain to develop a devoted and sizeable following. And when that doesn’t happen (and statistically speaking it will not), the negative aspects of the failed attempt weigh extremely heavy on the impressionable mind of a young kid. According to the Brookings Institution , a nonpartisan and nonprofit public policy organization based in Washington, DC, “ while computer programmers may not create algorithms that start out being discriminatory, the collection and curation of social preferences eventually can become adaptive algorithms that embrace societal biases. If we accept that the implicit bias of developers could unintentionally lead their algorithms to be discriminatory, then, with the same token, we should also expect the biases of such programmers to lead to discriminatory algorithms that favor their ideology .” In other words, these technologies are designed to select only the most engaging and relevant content for each individual user and, in the process, deliberately ignore any alternative philosophies, thereby making the reader more vulnerable to manipulation. Effectively, these big tech giants have, for years, been deliberately and knowingly brainwashing readers to a single point of view, creating a generation’s worth of predisposed pseudo-intellectuals who feign insight by reiterating what has been encoded into their persuaded minds. It is outrageous to the point of criminality. These (very powerful) companies have been effectively operating exactly as tyrannical regimes, shadow banning those who oppose their views, suspending those who question their methods and eliminating those who demand accountability. Social media platforms are rapidly becoming the primary source of news information in the United States and across the world. Yet these platforms are not only manipulating the type of news that you are exposed to but allowing you to absorb content that is intentionally published with dubious accuracy. And no one is holding them accountable. Here's the thing. We all know that these big tech giants are in it for the money. And, in a way, that is capitalistically understandable. But if we want to keep this thing from flying off the rails, we really need to start considering the question of regulating social-media platforms and other internet services. These companies should not have stayed under the radar for this long, transparency, fairness and privacy are some of the major topics to consider regarding these platforms.",

Our grandparents are a lot wiser than the kids today because they read more or they engaged more with each other with spoken conversation. Today lots of people do not speak to one another... Social media engagement and media engagement work on parts of the brain that we do not use for inhibition. We need more activities that help us to train our brains to reject. Like eating a lot of foods than can create free radicals (fried chips, etc) you need antioxidants that can absorb those radicals before they do too much damage. Those antioxidants are books, speaking to each other about those books, and more books. A lot of kids don't read at their grade level. I have seen the benefits of playing chess and there should be national movement to get a lot more kids to play chess because it engages the mind where reading engages.",

As all those smartest drones are labelled for AI Research and each of them is aware and could recognize that this task is performed better or bad (could #recognize images, produce human-like-language, #evaluate themselves, AI/ML). Hence those human-likes are blowing our minds. For those AI who did evil stuffs, are they loosing their minds, becoming insane as human do, immediately after blowing a terrorist's brains? How do you destroy these Human-like being? and Who will destroy GPT-3? Although the 10 years of proving that AI's self-aware and #conscience, might be just an investigative research and validation period, I still find this concept to have been #proven before the waiting period.😂 😁",

    "post_text": "ChatGPT is still hot, but why? ChatGPT is a powerful artificial intelligence tool that can generate human-like text. It uses state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) technology to understand and respond to human input. How does it work? ChatGPT is a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5, an update that the company had not previously announced. GPT-3's technology is simple. It takes your requests, questions, or prompts and quickly answers them. As you would imagine, the technology to do this is a lot more complicated than it sounds. Some news and viral tweets about ChatGPT: Explain AI Alignment in a weird style! Write an app to summarize essays. Effortlessly string together cloud services to do complex tasks. The most underrated one is the elimination of recipe sagas. Solving computer networks assignment. 🔥Geoffrey Hinton is a pioneering researcher in the development of artificial neural networks. He helped popularize backpropagation and invented the Boltzmann machine. Recently, he published a new paper describing a new algorithm called The Forward-Forward Algorithm (FF) . The biggest criticism against backpropagation is the fact that it doesn’t work as our brain. FF is instead offered as a more realistic learning model.

    "post_text": "Machine Learning Course (Caltech) By Yaser Abu-Mostafa This is an introductory course on machine learning that covers basic theory, algorithms, and applications. Machine learning (ML) enables computational systems to adaptively improve their performance with experience accumulated from the observed data. ML techniques are widely applied in engineering, science, finance, and commerce to build systems for which we do not have full mathematical specifications (and that covers a lot of systems). The course balances theory and practice and covers the mathematical as well as the heuristic aspects. Making Friends with Machine Learning By Cassie Kozyrkov The course is designed to give you the tools you need for effective participation in machine learning to solve business problems and for being a good citizen in an increasingly AI-fueled world. MFML is perfect for all humans; it focuses on conceptual understanding (rather than the mathematical and programming details) and guides you through the ideas that form the basis of successful approaches to machine learning. Machine Learning (Stanford) By Andrew Ng This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include supervised learning (generative/discriminative learning, parametric/non-parametric learning, neural networks, support vector machines); unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, kernel methods); learning theory (bias/variance tradeoffs, practical advice); reinforcement learning and adaptive control. The course will also discuss recent applications of machine learning, such as robotic control, data mining, autonomous navigation, bioinformatics, speech recognition, and text and web data processing. Machine Learning for Intelligent Systems (CORNELL) By Kilian Weinberger The goal of this course is to give an introduction to the field of machine learning. The course will teach you basic skills to decide which learning algorithm to use for what problem, code up your own learning algorithm and evaluate and debug it. Prerequisites: CSE 241 and sufficient mathematical maturity (Matrix Algebra, probability theory/statistics, multivariate calculus). Applied Machine Learning (CORNELL) By Volodymyr Kuleshov Starting from the very basics, we cover all of the most important ML algorithms and how to apply them in practice. The slides are also Jupyter notebooks with programmatically generated figures. Readers can tweak parameters and regenerate the figures themselves. Also, whenever we introduce an important mathematical formula, we implement it in NumPy. This helps establish connections between the math and how to apply it in code. Another idea we tried was to include 3 full lectures on how to apply ML in practice in a principled way. This includes topics such as how to prioritize model improvements, diagnose overfitting, perform error analysis, visualize loss curves, etc. Machine Learning with Graphs (Stanford) By Jure Leskovec This course covers important research on the structure and analysis of such large social and information networks and on models and algorithms that abstract their basic properties. Students will explore how to practically analyze large-scale network data and how to reason about it through models for network structure and evolution. Probabilistic Machine Learning (Tübingen) By Philipp Hennig The course covers the probabilistic (\"Bayesian\") paradigm for machine learning, and occasionally draws direct connections to statistical (e.g. Lecture 10) and deep learning (e.g. Lecture 8). The course is aimed at master's students in computer science and related fields. Introduction to Deep Learning (MIT) By Alexander Amini & Ava Soleimany Introductory course on deep learning methods with applications to computer vision, natural language processing, biology, and more! Students will gain foundational knowledge of deep learning algorithms and get practical experience in building neural networks in TensorFlow. Deep Unsupervised Learning (UC Berkeley) By Pieter Abbeel, Peter Chen, Jonathan Ho, Aravind Srinivas This course will cover two areas of deep learning in which labeled data is not required: Deep Generative Models and Self-supervised Learning. Recent advances in generative models have made it possible to realistically model high-dimensional raw data such as natural images, audio waveforms, and text corpora. Strides in self-supervised learning have started to close the gap between supervised representation learning and unsupervised representation learning in terms of fine-tuning to unseen tasks. This course will cover the theoretical foundations of these topics as well as their newly enabled applications. Deep Learning (Stanford) By Andrew Ng You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. You will work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. You will master not only the theory but also see how it is applied in the industry. You will practice all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow, which we will teach. Practical Deep Learning for Coders (Fastai) By Sylvain Gugger and Jeremy Howard How to train models that achieve state-of-the-art results. How to turn your models into web applications, and deploy them. Why and how deep learning models work, and how to use that knowledge to improve the accuracy, speed, and reliability of your models. The latest deep learning techniques that really matter in practice. How to implement stochastic gradient descent and a complete training loop from scratch. How to think about the ethical implications of your work, to help ensure that you're making the world a better place and that your work isn't misused for harm. Deep Learning (UC Berkeley) By Sergey Levine This is an introductory deep learning course covering a broad range of deep learning topics (basic machine learning, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, transformers, NLP, reinforcement learning, generative models & GANs. Deep Learning (NYU) By Yann LeCun & Alfredo Canziani This course concerns the latest techniques in deep learning and representation learning, focusing on supervised and unsupervised deep learning, embedding methods, metric learning, convolutional and recurrent nets, with applications to computer vision, natural language understanding, and speech recognition. Deep Learning Lecture Series (DeepMind x UCL) By multiple lecturers In this lecture series, leading research scientists from the leading AI research lab, DeepMind, deliver 12 lectures on an exciting selection of topics in Deep Learning, ranging from the fundamentals of training neural networks via advanced ideas around memory, attention, and generative modeling to the important topic of responsible innovation. Full Stack Deep Learning (UC Berkeley) By Sergey Karayev, Pieter Abbeel & Josh Tobin This course teaches full-stack production deep learning: Formulating the problem and estimating project cost. Finding, cleaning, labeling, and augmenting data. Picking the right framework and computing infrastructure. Troubleshooting training and ensuring reproducibility. Deploying the model at scale.",

This issue is sponsored by AtScale and Insilico Medicine ✅ [Inc.] Microsoft Becomes the First in Big Tech To Retire This AI Technology: First, there was an assumption that emotions come in defined categories: Happy, Sad, Angry, etc. Second, that these defined categories have equally defined external manifestations on your face. [The Verge] A million people on DALL-E’s waitlist: The company says it’s taking steps like blocking uploads of realistic faces to reduce the creation of deceptive content and prohibiting users from generating “violent, adult, or political content, among other categories .” [IEEE] WILL AI STEAL SUBMARINES’ STEALTH?

Like many AIs designed to create artwork in various mediums based on prompts, it takes practice and skill to get usable chunks of text — users have to learn to communicate ideas with the AI, making the process something akin to a machine-human collaboration. [MIT] Inside a radical new project to democratize AI: A group of over 1,000 AI researchers has created a multilingual large language model bigger than GPT-3—and they’re giving it out for free.

    "post_text": "Survivorship bias: This might be Old but definitely inspiring During World War II, fighter planes would come back from battle with bullet holes. The Allies found the areas that were most commonly hit by enemy fire. They sought to strengthen the most commonly damaged parts of the planes to reduce the number that was shot down. A mathematician, Abraham Wald, pointed out that perhaps there was another way to look at the data. Perhaps the reason certain areas of the planes weren't covered in bullet holes was that planes that were shot in those areas did not return. This insight led to the armor being re-enforced on the parts of the plane where there were no bullet holes. The story behind the data is arguably more important than the data itself. Or more precisely, the reason behind why we are missing certain pieces of data may be more meaningful than the data we have. Refrences: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 [NewScientist] AI can help historians restore ancient texts from damaged inscriptions: An AI tool developed by DeepMind can help historians restore ancient Greek texts with 72 percent accuracy, and date inscriptions to within 30 years of their true age [TC] Strong Compute wants to speed up your ML model training : While there are companies that focus on optimizing the models themselves and Strong Compute will also do that if its customers request it, Sand noted that this may compromise the results. [Sky News] 'I fell in love with my AI girlfriend - and it saved my marriage': A man who was struggling to support his depressed wife says his AI girlfriend has given him the love he needed to keep their family together. [Lexology] World’s first impact assessment tool for AI in healthcare : One way to mitigate these risks is to conduct an AIA prior to the design and development of an AI system. An AIA is a tool used to assess the possible societal impacts of an AI system before the system is in use (although ongoing monitoring of the system is advised). [Engadget] LinkedIn and DeepMind co-founders form AI startup to help humans talk to computers: The hope, according to Suleyman, is that you'll speak to computers in ordinary language — this will \"almost certainly\" be possible in five years, he said.

[Brookings] Why is AI adoption in health care lagging? Several aspects of the health care system involve prediction, including diagnosis, and operations. This connection between ML’s capabilities and the needs of the health care system has led to AI having a large impact on health care.

    "post_text": "If you’ve been keeping up with the cryptocurrency world, you’ve probably come across the term “NFT.” They are one-of-a-kind, non-interchangeable digital assets that also serve as valid proof of ownership on the blockchain. Recently, an AI Art Piece broke the record of the highest price on the NFT market. Even if you don't want to buy or make NFTs, it is still better to educate yourself about the technology. What the hell are NFTs? Read more about NFTs in my previous issue . When most people think of NFTs, they think it is only the profile pics, some [Adjectives][Animals], or pixilated images. This couldn't be further from the truth! They were supposed to be digital representations of art, they are indivisible and non-replicable, to which people can attach value. Good news! There is a growing movement to make NFTs usable in several different ways by adding utilities to create a different kind of value proposition, on top of their scarcity and collectability. Utility NFTs have valuations based on the access and opportunities they provide to the holders. They offer clearly defined intrinsic value in addition to the usual scarcity associated with NFTs. The main types of NFTs are: One of the more novel concepts is the NFT staking or farming. This refers to staking NFTs to a protocol to earn a yield. It gives NFTs passive yield-generating utility and can be thought of as decentralized finance meets NFTs. A common concept in this scenario is the staking portal where you can turn compatible NFTs into vaults from which you earn rewards. An example of a staking portal would be the Genesis Farm. Where users are allowed to stake free MEME tokens to farm limited edition NFTs which can then be sold on NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea or Rarible. The market will mature in the near future and more utilities will be integrated into NFTs, which is, unfortunately, following a hyped trend now. Always, think about utilities and the long-term games and never buy NFTs from anonymous creators with no LinkedIn Account.

An example of a good use of NFT's would be the tracking of all the transactions in shipping where the current paper trail is cumbersome and time consuming as well as inaccurate. NFT's could speed up the process and make it much more accurate. The underlying Blochian technology that makes NFT's safe becomes more secure and beneficial when the rate of transactions is high and the complex nature of transactions and tracking of ownership makes the idea of NFT's useful when applied to complex transactional problems. The publicity stunt of selling a horribly pixelated lion for a ridiculous amount was simply that a publicity stunt designed to popularize NFT's and it worked, but now we should be responsible and stop trying to chance instant fortunes but apply NFT's to applications that they will work best for,",

    "post_text": "Don't trade NFTs unless you read this! What is NFT? you can check these posts ( 1 , 2 , 3 ). What are the types of NFTs? No NFTs are not just animal jpegs! Are they Scam or Ponzi schemes? Some of them based on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) definition are, but if you do your homework and avoid the red flags , the technology is an enabler for many great use cases. NFTs are new and unregulated, so there is more chance for people to misuse the hype. Especially, there has been a recent rise in fraudulent projects . OpenSea ( NFT Marketplace) reported that around 80 percent of the NFTs minted through its free creation tool had been identified as fraudulent, earmarked as either spam or scams. That's why many people believe that is all the same and overgeneralize the problem. The cartoon is attributed to 1889 and is entitled “The Unrestrained Demon”, referring to the electricity itself. There was some truth to this: in the early days of electrification when the importance of grounding/bonding wasn't well understood (or followed when it was), people were getting shocked at random, horses getting shocked through their iron shoes.** Not all NFTs are scams and Fraudulent. I still believe they are all scams or I don't have the capacity to find the ones that are legit, should I still buy them? Absolutely not, stay away from NFTs and enjoy your life! If you are really in for the trouble then keep reading, as, with any financial decision , you should do a lot of research before getting started, not just on the project, but on the NFT industry as a whole. These are some tips: (This is not financial Advice make sure to do your own research) Look who is behind the project and what are the creators’ backstories are good places to start. Never ever buy NFTs from unknown and anonymous creators. Having a LinkedIn account is a must unless you are into gambling! Don't buy NFTs that have no intrinsic value from a real-world utility or if it is too complex to understand. Only buy art NFTs if you are enjoying them yourself and not for the profit, because there is a high chance to lose money after the hype fades away. I made a poll a while ago and only 12% of voters (2700+) believe NFTs are bought for the art! But, it would be great to have a pleasant art piece on top of some utility. Finally, check if the majority of the community that supports the project are legit NFT collectors and not flippers. It is easy to get overwhelmed by the numbers but are they real? They can be bots and paid resources from low-wage countries that try to inflate the numbers by saying gm/gn a couple of times a day. As I mentioned before 90% of the current projects are going to fail soon, make sure you are not holding a bag full of them.

    "post_text": "Choosing a Framework for Deep Learning (TensorFlow vs PyTorch vs Keras) Which one do you use more and why? We usually make decisions based on these factors: Evaluating the needs, Parameter optimization, Scaling, training, and deployment. TensorFlow : It is one of the best-known deep learning frameworks out there. It started life as an internal project at Google Brain to help improve some of Google’s services such as Gmail, Photos, and the ubiquitous Google search engine. It was made public in late 2015. PyTorch : Python is at the center of its development and design principles. PyTorch is also an open-source project that builds upon a few projects spearheaded by FB's research, PyTorch lets users create systems for computer vision, conversational AI, and personalization. Version 1.0 was released in 2018. Keras : It is another important deep learning framework that is worth considering. Not only is it also based in Python like PyTorch, but it also has a high-level neural net API that has been adopted by the likes of TensorFlow to create new architectures. It is an open-source framework offered under an MIT License. Still, 2 more days before closing the poll, check my posts here for more info. [ARTnews] AI-Generated Andy Warhol to Narrate New Netflix Documentary Series: In the show, Warhol can be heard reading from his diaries. That voice, however, is not the artist’s own but rather the product of AI made to sound like him. [Fortune] The next generation of brain-computing interfaces could be supercharged by artificial intelligence: A more realistic near-term future regarding brain implants and A.I. is that neural networks could help researchers better understand the human brain, which could, in turn, lead to more advanced medical breakthroughs.

In CX, we see companies using AI to augment human interactions, increase customer satisfaction, and respond to customer service issues faster. [TNW] Who gets to decide if an AI is alive? Experts predict artificial intelligence will gain sentience within the next 100 years. Some predict it’ll happen sooner. Others say it’ll never happen. Still, other experts say it already has happened.

It is a combination of the Internet Of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, 5G & Moore’s Law. The metaverse isn’t just a buzzword, it is the inevitable evolution of the internet. It’s more than NFTs and VR goggles, it’s the shift in how we communicate using technology. The Internet Of Things aspect provides glasses, goggles, and bodysuits that receive real-time data and react accordingly. The blockchain provides NFTs that secure assets, smart contracts, and incentive models that create trustless reward mechanisms. Augmented Reality creates digital elements in the real world. Virtual reality is a 360-degree interactive environment. Artificial Intelligence allows features, assets, and environments to have logic that improves the experience of the metaverse over time. 5G allows for nearly instant communication and real-time feedback. Finally, Moore’s Law guarantees that technology will continue to get smaller and more powerful. What looks like a Janky headset today becomes ray ban sunglasses tomorrow and contact lenses the day after. The metaverse is the tech boom.",

    "post_text": "Web 3.0 and NFTs are dominating the Fintech news these days, you all have heard about crazy amounts paid for art pieces that might not look so impressive from the technical perspective. Also, many artists are using AI to generate some unique art pieces including AI-generated Voices , which makes it more interesting for me. The revolution is not limited to the art market. While NFT adoption in gaming has already reached a certain maturity, for example concerning the trade of in-game objects, different other industries, especially those involved with the production of digital content such as music or video, are experimenting with the technology. So what is NFT? Non-Fungible just means that you can’t interchange one asset from another. A token in the case of NFTs is just a certificate of authenticity that sits on a blockchain — which makes the token verifiable and visible to everyone. Thus, an NFT is a unique digital asset in the forms of art, videos, audio, and any other form of digital creation. NFTs can be used for practical governance use cases like copyright and general storage of sensitive, social information that would otherwise be too prone to abuse in the hands of centralized authorities that increasingly demonstrate contempt for the public. Records such as voter tallies, census information, titles of ownership, and medical records may be able to find protection within an NFT framework that is publicly owned. The future of NFTs goes far beyond social status, memes or multimillion-dollar works of art turned profile pictures. This is just the beginning of a global revolution that started out disrupting banking and is now going to disrupt everything else. 98% of NFTs in 2022 will be a bad investment. It's only a matter of time before most of the NFT artworks will lose their allure to all but a small group of enthusiasts. NFTs are much more than profile pics, make sure to buy Utilities not the hype! This is not financial advice, always do your own research.

While previous estimates from organizations like Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, and various universities indicated significant automation potential, the MIT study focused specifically on the economic feasibility of automating jobs requiring visual analysis. It found that the majority of these jobs are not yet economically beneficial to automate. The study calculated the costs of deploying and maintaining AI systems, revealing that only a small fraction of wages for vision tasks would justify automation. The researchers also considered more affordable, self-hosted AI systems but found that many jobs still wouldn't be cost-effective to automate. They emphasized that the transition to AI automation in certain tasks will take decades and acknowledged limitations such as not considering AI's role in augmenting human labor. The study also addressed potential bias concerns due to funding from the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. Finally, it advised policymakers to prepare for AI job automation and highlighted the need for AI developers to focus on reducing costs and expanding the scope of AI deployment. 🧠 Meta Released a Prompt Engineering cookbook It is an interactive guide covering prompt engineering and best practices for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts working with large language models. ✔Some of the ideas: Role Prompting: Assigning roles to the model can yield more consistent and contextually appropriate responses. Chain-of-Thought Prompting: Encouraging a step-by-step thought process in prompts significantly improves the model's ability to perform complex reasoning. Self-Consistency: The self-consistency method enhances accuracy by generating multiple responses and selecting the most frequent answer. Retrieval-Augmented Generation: This technique involves incorporating external facts into prompts to provide more accurate and factual information. More... Many thanks for the support!

    "post_text": "Web3 is an umbrella term for ideas of eliminating the big middlemen on the internet. To better understand Web3, let’s go through Web1 and Web2 first and have a comparison of the features. Web1: Read-Only The majority of users using the internet in the ‘90s were consumers on static web pages and rarely produced content. People came onto the internet to consume read-only content. There were a few “internet companies” controlled content on the internet. Web2: Read-Write Web2 is what we mostly engage these days took over in the early 2000s. It made space for everyone to become a content creator and consumer simultaneously on social networks, i.e. Linkedin, Twitter, and Facebook, who can leverage or sell personal data to generate impressive amounts of revenue because centralized companies have ownership over user data and all user-generated content. Users can: Classify and sort information Create and develop APIs for interoperability across different software Create and share dynamic and responsive content with others Send and receive information from different sources Access content from mobile devices, multimedia consoles, televisions, and more Web3: Read-Write-Own The shift from Web2 to Web3 is largely due to infrastructure advancement and a mindset shift for developers as governance will be much more user-centered. With the removal of a middleman and data living on immutable infrastructure, there is no control over data and less risk of data loss. One of the most significant implications of decentralization and blockchain technology is in the area of data ownership and compensation. As we move toward Web 3.0 and the technologies that support it mature and become scalable, I believe the web will reflect its original intent. Non-fungible tokens ( NFTs ) will also play a huge role in reshaping the gaming industry by allowing players to become the immutable owners of the items they accrue. Some believe that starting with Web3 is by setting up your crypto wallet (i.e. MetaMask) connected to decentralized apps to interact and conduct transactions. Web 3.0 is a leap forward, it creates the infrastructure needed for humans and machines to interact, create, find, and share distributed data, make accurate predictions with artificial intelligence, and be empowered to control one’s identity through a web of trust, security, and privacy. [MIT] Meta’s new learning algorithm can teach AI to multi-task Data2vec uses two neural networks, a student and a teacher. First, the teacher network is trained on images, text, or speech in the usual way, learning an internal representation of this data that allows it to predict what it is seeing when shown new examples. When it is shown a photo of a dog, it recognizes it as a dog.

    "post_text": "You dont need to be a Crypto maximalist to understand the potential of an enaibler technology. I am not talking about JPGs and profile pictures here, it is much bigger than the current hype. Before even starting, I need to say 90% of the current NFT projects will fail soon and will have no values in future. If you dont know what are NFTs, please check my post here . Having said that there is a future for NFTs that I totally recommend everyone to learn more about the ecosystem and usecases. This topic is not very trendy on Linkedin yet but I am going to start a series of educational posts called \" 30 days of Web3.0 \" to share may views and experiences about many related topics including NFTs. If you are still considering to enter this risky market, make sure to read the rest carefully. These are 4 factors that will help you make the right decision finding high potential projects: 1- The team behind the project: Even if you are just buying to flip it, make sure they are real people with some tracable background. Having a LinkedIn account is a bonus. Check their past experiences and relevance to the current project. Like any other businesses you need to look for a diverse skills including art, tech and business. 2- The community : Most of the projects have a discord space and social media accounts. Check their engagements to understand if the members are real or bots. Ideally, there is a couple of thousands active users on their discord channels talking about relevant topics. 3- The utility: If you are an art lover and collector, Skip this one! It is very important to get something more than just a pixelated ( or even a high res) animal image. When the hype goes away this will save the value of the asset. Some of the projects have a crazy roadmap but you need to check their team to ensure they can deliver it. Like any other businesses, there is always a chance to get fooled by another Theranos . 4- The artifact : Apart from some early examples, these days most NFTs need to have pleasing aethtetics. Art is subjective but at least it should feel good for you If not buying a purly Utility NFTs. It is always better to buy an NFT that has a known artist with a track of record on Linkedin/Instagram. After following all of these, still there is no guarantee the NFT that you bought would hold the value in the short/long term. So, make sure to use some assets that you can afford to lose. In near future, when the hype goes away and the technology matures to have more utility NFTs with a concrete offerings, there will be less risks/rewards. This is a poll I posted on Linked a couple of days ago, the results are really interesting. I you have not voted yet, you can find it here. **I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. NFT space is risky now, do your own research and make decisions carefully** [LinkedIn Post] New shape-shifting micro robot swims through the body to deliver the cancer drug directly to the target. [PcGamer] Deep Learning Dynamic Super Resolution (DLDSR) is Nvidia’s method for letting users easily downsample games . The result is extremely effective anti-aliasing but only performs well if a GPU has the extra horsepower to run at that higher resolution. It’s a good way to make older games with outdated anti-aliasing technology look cleaner. [NewsMedical] AI systems can accurately identify and grade prostate cancer: The international validation was performed via a competition called PANDA. The competition lasted for three months and challenged more than 1000 AI experts to develop systems for accurately grading prostate cancer. [ZDNet] Meta's AI simulates lip-reading: The software uses the popular approach of \"attention\" to make videos of speakers' lips and audio waveforms reinforce one another in ways much more efficient and accurate than prior approaches. [TheFastMode] Nokia, Schweizer Deploy AI-based Video Analytics to Improve Railroad Safety: The AI-based system applies computer vision and machine learning technologies for real-time monitoring and analysis, to ensure the safety of railroad crossings. As the first deployment of this kind in Europe demonstrated the reliability of AI-based railroad safety solutions for daily use. [Mirage] New UK initiative to shape global standards for Artificial Intelligence :The Alan Turing Institute selected to lead pilot of a new AI Standards Hub supported by the British Standards Institution and National Physical Laboratory. Hub is part of the National AI Strategy and will aim to increase UK contribution to development of global AI technical standards. [VB] How to build a data science and machine learning roadmap in 2022 : Producing models at scale using MLOps is different from producing mainstream internal apps with DevOps. The more complex the operating model of a business unit, the steeper the MLOps learning curve. DSML’s contributions to business units vary by the availability of reliable data and how clearly defined problem statements are. [O'reilly] What’s ahead for AI, VR, NFTs, and more? We’ll see more “AI as a service” (AIaaS) products. Prompt engineering, a field dedicated to developing prompts for language generation systems, will become a new specialization. AI-assisted programming has a long way to go, but it will make quick progress and soon become just another tool in the programmer’s toolbox. [FastCompany] Five steps to bringing new AI technology to market : From healthcare to automotive, customers who were asked to adopt AI into their human processes were resistant and distrustful. After years of mentoring other companies, I’ve identified the extra steps involved and the psychological motivations behind bringing new partners to new technology. [FB] A ConvNet for the 2020s: The \"Roaring 20s\" of visual recognition began with the introduction of Vision Transformers (ViTs), which quickly superseded ConvNets as the state-of-the-art image classification model. A vanilla ViT, on the other hand, faces difficulties when applied to general computer vision tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation ( CODE ) [WEF] We’re failing at the ethics of AI. Here’s how we make real impact : The global COVID-19 crisis has acted as a world-wide accelerator for the rollout of artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. The ethics and governance of AI systems are unclear. We need to advance in three main issues to make a real impact. This video explains how AI creates its anime characters: {Sponsored}Join the Index Ventures AI Summit 2022 and [beyond] specially geared to AI startups, researchers, and developers, with top mind speakers: Fei-Fei Li, Pieter Abbeel, Reid Hoffman, and 20 more.

Food and retail delivery robots for use within airports and for curbside delivery ( Ottonomy ). Smart driver-facing cameras for cars and trucks that sound an alert when a driver is falling asleep or not watching the road, either for industrial fleets ( SmartWitness ) or as a consumer safety device ( Xperi ) or an enhancement dashcams ( NextBase ), where the ability to record road rage incidents or aggressive police road stops is an additional benefit. A software framework for running deep neural network AI models on small, power-constrained devices ( Deeplite ). A partnership between Fluent.ai , a specialist in voice AI, and the audio tech experts at Knowles Corp. , on voice command applications for compact, low-power devices. Computer vision packed into compact devices for the visually impaired that can read — and extract meaning from — a full page of text at a glance, as well as a hearing aid that uses visual cues like reading the lips of the person the listener is talking with at a party to know which sounds to amplify ( OrCam ).

[Nippon] An AI Revolution in Sports Scoring Technology : It automatically scores gymnastic routines has solved many of the problems that used to plague the judging process in that sport. However, the development process was by no means plain sailing. [VB] How no-code AI development platforms could introduce model bias : One point of concern with these tools is that, like everything to do with the AI boom, they look and sound serious, official and safe. So if they tell you that you’ve improved your predictive accuracy by 20% with this new model, you might not be inclined to ask why unless they tell you. [EuroNews] As well as chatting to you, can AI chatbots now tell how you’re feeling too : The next generation of chatbots powered by artificial intelligence could be so adept and sympathetic in answering your queries that you might never be able to tell them apart from their flesh and blood counterparts.

[TDWI] How Symbolic AI Yields Cost Savings, Business Results Commonly used for segments of AI (NLP) and (NLU), symbolic AI follows an IF-THEN logic structure. When an IF linguistic condition is met, a THEN output is generated. Symbolic AI works best when rules are straightforward. [ArXiv] Vision Transformer for Small-Size Datasets: Vision Transformer (ViT), which applied the transformer structure to the image classification task, has outperformed convolutional neural networks.

    "post_text": "If you’ve been keeping up with the cryptocurrency world, you’ve probably come across the term “NFT.” They are one-of-a-kind, non-interchangeable digital assets that also serve as valid proof of ownership on the blockchain. Recently, an AI Art Piece broke the record of the highest price on the NFT market. Read more about NFTs in my previous issue . When most people think of NFTs, they think it is only the profile pics, some [Adjectives][Animals], or pixilated images. This couldn't be further from the truth ! They were supposed to be digital representations of art, they are indivisible and non-replicable, to which people can attach value. Good news! There is a growing movement to make NFTs usable in several different ways by adding utilities to create a different kind of value proposition, on top of their scarcity and collectability. Utility NFTs have valuations based on the access and opportunities they provide to the holders. They offer clearly defined intrinsic value in addition to the usual scarcity associated with NFTs. It is still the early stages of utility NFTs but they are broadly classified into the following categories: Community NFTs Sports NFTs Gambling NFTs In-game NFTs Social NFTs One of the more novel concepts is the NFT staking or farming. This refers to staking NFTs to a protocol to earn a yield. It gives NFTs passive yield-generating utility and can be thought of as decentralized finance meets NFTs. A common concept in this scenario is the staking portal where you can turn compatible NFTs into vaults from which you earn rewards. An example of a staking portal would be the Genesis Farm. Where users are allowed to stake free MEME tokens to farm limited edition NFTs which can then be sold on NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea or Rarible. I have shared a poll on LinkedIn 3 days ago asking \"Have you ever bought NFTs?\". It received 7000+ responses and the result is very interesting, check it here . Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, I don't encourage or discourage anyone to buy/ flip NFTs, It is a financial decision that should be made with care. Web 3.0 is interesting from the technology perspective for me and I just shared some bite-size simple explanations here. MIT’s top research stories of 2021 , Forbes 10 AI Predictions For 2022 [TC] Global stakeholders should use AI to mitigate impact of heat islands in cities : A map, or a topographic view, allows climate teams in municipalities to get the land surface temperature of every 30-meter block on the ground. Also, there’s a Scenario Modeling View that enables them to generate scenarios of the future urban sprawl of cities by modifying features like building counts and height and other urban sprawl parameters. [TC] Dental AI tech company raised 42 million: Boston-based Overjet’s dental AI software supports dentists in understanding what the scans show with regard to disease identification and progression [MIT] Characters for good, created by artificial intelligence: Researchers encourage positive use cases of AI-generated characters for education and well-being. A team from a couple of universities have compiled an open-source, easy-to-use character generation pipeline that combines AI models for facial gestures, voice, and motion and can be used to create a variety of audio and video outputs. [Health it analytics] Using Artificial Intelligence to Identify Fractures on X-rays : This AI algorithm can quickly and automatically detect x-rays that are positive for fractures and flag those studies in the system so that radiologists can prioritize reading x-rays with positive fractures. [VB] NLP is the heart of the intelligent enterprise: Back-office functions ranging from software development and data analytics to systems management and risk assessment become far more efficient and effective when humans can simply speak their desires rather than type them in or click their way through endless menus. [HBR] 50 Global Hubs for Top AI Talent : Building ethical AI that works for everyone will require a diverse workforce that brings a broad range of perspectives. To achieve this, however, companies will need to look outside of the usual hubs, such as San Francisco. To aid in that effort, the authors have compiled the top 50 cities for AI talent and analyzed how diverse the population of developers is in each. [Gardian] Can AI really predict crime: The Los Angeles police department rolled out the first predictive policing programme of its kind in the US, allowing the LAPD to use historical data to predict with laser precision (hence the name) where future crimes might be committed and who might commit them.

    "post_text": "Last week, I got invited to emcee the AI Innovation Expo by Boab and moderate two-panel discussions about AI. First, there was a debate between Dr Catriona Wallace and Jeremy Howard on the topic of “Is the AI existential threat real?” Separate from the issues of bias that occur with machine learning algorithms, there is a belief that artificial intelligence may pose a distinct threat to the future of human life on the planet. I would totally recommend watching the full discussion here . A common theme with AI entrepreneurship is that companies should target international opportunities as opposed to just a local market like Australia. The second-panel session was aimed at getting the views of each of the esteemed speakers to not only argue that AI companies should be looking to push their products to international markets, but also provide practical tips on how to do so. Panelists: Jeremy Howard , Dr Catriona Wallace , Natalie Piucco , and Jeremy Cooper , an excellent mix of panelists who provided practical and strategic advice on how to go global with AI products. You can watch it here . Finally, a ‘Shark Tank’ style event whereby each company is given a short amount of time to pitch their company and receive short feedback from each of the judges. An interactive session whereby the audience can select their favorite company. Don't forget to check it out here . [Verge] DeepMind tests the limits of large AI language systems with a 280-billion-parameter model : The language model is named Gopher, parameters are a quick measure of a language’s models size and complexity, meaning that Gopher is larger than OpenAI’s GPT-3 (175 billion parameters) but not as big as some more experimental systems, like Microsoft and Nvidia’s Megatron model (530 billion parameters). [LinkedIn Post] First look at the most advanced humanoid robot from Engineered Arts Designed as a platform for AI and human-robot interaction (HRI) [Meta AI] Detecting manipulated images: The Image Similarity Challenge results and winners: Most of us edit our online photos for fun: to enhance a sunset or give a friend cartoon bunny ears. But some people manipulate pictures to spread misinformation or to evade tools designed to detect harmful content. Even after a platform removes an image for breaking its rules, automatic tools might miss modified copies reposted by others. [NewScientits] AI reads boring terms and conditions documents so you don't have to : Almost no one reads the long and complicated T&C agreements found on websites and apps, but now an AI can pick out the important bits for you. These legal documents are famously impenetrable – a 2019 study of 500 popular websites found that 99% required a reading age beyond that of the average person in the US. [MIT] Machine-learning system flags remedies that might do more harm than good: Sepsis claims the lives of nearly 270,000 people in the U.S. each year. The unpredictable medical condition can progress rapidly, leading to a swift drop in blood pressure, tissue damage, multiple organ failure, and death. [VB] How bias creeps into the AI designed to detect toxicity: Studies show that language models amplify the biases in data on which they were trained. For instance, Codex, a code-generating model developed by OpenAI, can be prompted to write “terrorist” when fed the word “Islam.” Another large language model from Cohere tends to associate men and women with stereotypically “male” and “female” occupations, like “male scientist” and “female housekeeper.” [Google AI] Unlocking human rights information with machine learning: Human rights defenders need information from many sources to do their work effectively. But as issues evolve and new precedents are set, finding the right information to defend a particular case can be like looking for a needle in a haystack. [Google AI] Perspectives on Issues in AI Governance : This paper can help in evolving the discussion to address pragmatic policy ideas and implementation. The ‘rules of the road’ for AI (be they in the form of laws or norms) will need to evolve over time to reflect thoughtful and informed consideration of economic and social priorities and attitudes, as well as keeping pace with what is possible technologically. [MIT] Tiny machine learning design alleviates a bottleneck in memory usage on internet-of-things devices TinyML offers numerous advantages over deep machine learning that happens on larger devices, like remote servers and smartphones. These include privacy since the data are not transmitted to the cloud for computing but processed on the local device; robustness, as the computing, is quick and the latency is low; and low cost, because IoT devices cost roughly $1 to $2 [Paper] WantWords: An Open-source Online Reverse Dictionary System: ( CODE ): A reverse dictionary takes descriptions of words as input and outputs words semantically matching the input descriptions.

    "post_text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) used to be thought of as an idealistic technology that can only exist in sci-fi movies. Contrasting to the belief, today the technology has become so mature in a short tenure that all major companies are using it to their advantage. AI has become a major catalyst in driving the next revolution. The rate of progress in the field of artificial intelligence is exponentially increasing and impacting our lives like never before. From self-driving cars to robots replacing our jobs, everything seemed like a distant reality is within our vision. For all those reasons( and more ), many get interested in learning more about AI, but there are some barriers to learning this shiny topic. Information overload and too much noise are major reasons that I decided to start this series. I have shared some easy-to-understand free resources and guidelines to help those who are new to this topic. No one can become an AI expert in 40 days or 100 days, yet by following the pathway and keep practicing you will be able to find the path for success. This article is going to be the repository of my posts, check it out here . [Wired] Can AI Truly Give Us a Glimpse of Lost Masterpieces? As part of an ongoing research and conservation program called Operation Night Watch, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam is using machine learning to decode Rembrandt van Rijn’s original vision for The Night Watch , a piece that was trimmed on all four sides to fit a new location in 1715. [UN] 193 countries adopt the first global agreement on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence: All the nations members of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) adopted on Thursday a historical text that defines the common values and principles needed to ensure the healthy development of AI. [LinkedIn Post] No need to search, AI will paint you the image: The GauGan 2 is out and it uses a deep learning model that turns a simple written phrase, or sentence, into a photorealistic masterpiece. [CNBC] Meta and Microsoft announced a partnership to integrate Workplace and Teams: The partnership between Meta and Microsoft brings together two rivals that compete in the market of enterprise communication software. This could prove most beneficial to Meta, whose Workplace service lags drastically behind its competitors in terms of users. [Verge] Alphabet is putting its prototype robots to work cleaning up around Google’s offices : A team within the experimental X labs dedicated to creating “a general-purpose learning robot” — has moved some of its prototype machines out of the lab and into Google ’s Bay Area campuses to carry out some light custodial tasks. [TC] Robots and AI assist in designing and building Swiss university’s ‘hanging gardens’: The project is a sort of huge sculptural planter, “hanging gardens” inspired by the legendary structures in the ancient city of Babylon . (Incidentally, it was my ancestor, Robert Koldewey, who excavated/looted the famous Ishtar Gate to the place.) [VB] AI will soon oversee its own data management: AI-driven data management will speed up the pace of business dramatically. Data is king in the digital universe, and kings don’t like to wait. [ArXiv] MetaFormer is Actually What You Need for Vision ( Paper / Code ): It is the key player in achieving superior results for recent transformer and MLP-like models on vision tasks. PoolFormer could serve as a starting baseline for future MetaFormer architecture design [FACEBOOK AI] Detectron Q&A: The origins, evolution, and future of our pioneering computer vision library [CIO] \"Powered by AI\" has become a marketing gimmick [TF] Introducing TensorFlow Graph Neural Networks [Cell] Using Night Vision and A.I., Scientists Recorded Spiders’ Entire Choreography for Web Building: [💥] Don't miss the innovative AI Expo: AI Scaleup Pitches , How To Go Global With AI , and the debate between Dr. Catriona Wallace and Jeremy Howard on the topic of “ Is the AI existential threat real ? {sponsored} [📜] Deep Learning Tips & Tricks Cheatsheet [📚] 800+ Data Science Questions & Answers [🎤] Data Analytics Podcast [🚀] Resume & Cover Letter Guide - Harvard University 2020 [🦊] Ctrl + Z 😎 Thanks for your support and have a great weekend ☕ Steve 🤝For any collaboration inquiries, feel free to reach out to info@spotlit.ai",

    "post_text": "Responsible AI is probably one of the hottest topics in AI at the moment. It is the practice of designing, developing, and deploying AI with good intentions to empower humans and fairly impact society. I recently hosted a panel discussion with Dr. Emmanuel Goffi , Dr. Catriona Wallace , Surend Dayal , and Kirsty Linehan , about some of the most critical concerns surrounding AI, including ethical frameworks, the role of governments, and ensuring that new AI designs and applications are built around the principles of greater inclusiveness and increased fairness. I encourage you to go watch the replay in full . Don’t miss the discussions about the AI arms race and existential threats to humanity. [Nvidia] GTC21 : Next-Gen Cloud Computing, and Cybersecurity accelerating science, Building Virtual Worlds with Omniverse , Transforming Industries with AI, Omniverse Avatar for Intelligent Virtual Assistants [VB] AI-driven virtual characters: Apart From Nvidia, Inworld AI and Synthesis AI aim to develop a platform that enables users to create AI-driven virtual characters which can be used to populate virtual worlds. [Google AI] Enhanced Sleep Sensing in Nest Hub : these enhancements allow a better understanding of sleep through sleep stages and the separation of the user’s coughs and snores from other sounds in the room. [TC] Bipartisan bill to control recommendation algorithms: It would require companies like Meta to offer a version of their platforms that runs on an “input-transparent” algorithm. [The Verge] Google's parent company started a company to use AI for drug discovery : It’ll build off of the work done by DeepMind, another Alphabet subsidiary that has done groundbreaking work using AI to predict the structure of proteins . [LinkedIn Post] New platform to create AR : Qualcomm introduced a platform, for game developers that supports a cross-device ecosystem and AR glasses. [arXiv] Can I use this publicly available dataset to build commercial AI software? [Conversation] Unis are using AI to keep students sitting exams honest. But this creates its own problems : Proctoring technology allows exam-takers to be monitored off-campus, instead of a person having to watch them in a traditional exam room. Some programs simply enable a person to supervise students remotely. [LinkedIn Post] AnimeGANV2 : Transforming photos into anime-style images. [MIT] This is how AI bias happens and is hard to fix : We often shorthand our explanation of AI bias by blaming it on biased training data but bias can creep in long before the data is collected as well as at many other stages of the deep-learning process. [Free E-Book] How to Lead in Data Science : Best practices for leading projects while balancing complex trade-offs, techniques for specifying, prioritizing, and planning projects from vague requirements, and navigating structural challenges in the organization toward project success. {Please, consider buying the book if you found it interesting} [Video] Don't miss these interesting Math explainers, even if you don't like math!👇 [💥] MLOps repository : Github repo full of free talks, books, papers, and more [📑] AI papers repository : A collection of awesome AI papers [📜] Algebra and Calculus Cheatsheet [🎁] Win one of the 15 Nvidia Deep Learning Institue vouchers.

    "post_text": "Many consider artificial intelligence as the next-generation technology synonymous with the internet of the 1990s. In the past decade, we have seen great strides in the research and development of AI impacting many industries like healthcare, agriculture, defense, and more. AI systems are trained by combining these large amounts of data with fast, iterative processing and intelligent algorithms. It allows the software to learn automatically from patterns or features in the data. Today, there are mainly two ways to train and improve the accuracy of AI systems. The model-centric approach focuses on improving the algorithm, code, and model architecture used to train the model. The data-centric approach where the focus is to develop systematic engineering practices for improving data in ways that are reliable, efficient, and systematic. Andrew Ng, widely regarded as the pioneer of modern artificial intelligence, has a clear view on this debate. He strongly affirms that AI ecosystems must shift from a model-centric to a data-centric approach. According to him, this will have a significant impact on the quality of AI systems deployed. This means that the training is only a minor part of a Machine Learning model's lifecycle. This means, gathering and preparing high-quality data accounts for 80%, whereas the actual training accounts for only 20% of the AI system lifecycle. Despite this, training has been the primary focus of both industry and academia. Even Kaggle competitions are more focused on feature engineering and building stacks of ensemble models. However, this has been changing in recent years. The efficacy of a good AI model is judged by the benchmark datasets, where models are compared on specific metrics. More than 90% of AI research papers showcase improvements in the algorithm rather than the importance of data quality to the overall AI lifecycle. According to Andrew, this is a significant drawback in actual use cases as good quality data is crucial plays a vital role in improving benchmark results. He explains the importance of a data-centric approach with an example of steel sheets defect detection. The task is to identify the detects in steel rollers. By employing the data-centric approach to the problem, improving the data alone led to more than 15%. It is evident across different problem verticals, as shown in the above image. There are various aspects of a data-centric approach that can lead to high-quality models if done systematically. Few crucial metrics to gauge the quality of data are : Consistent Labelling The quality of training data is essential to the effectiveness of a machine learning model. The consistency and correctness of labeled data are used to determine quality. Benchmarks, consensus, and review are the standard industry procedures for confirming data quality. When labeling datasets, the labeling must be consistent among labelers and batches. Here is an example of the inconsistency that can occur while labeling a data point. One can see the labeling inconsistency done by different labelers. This can be catastrophic while training as it introduces noise in the data. With appropriate guidelines, it is possible to mitigate such inconsistencies. However, different interpretations of the guidelines lead to such errors. Further, Andrew suggests an approach to avoid such discrepancies. Ask two independent labelers to label a sample of images. Measure consistency between labelers to discover where they disagree. After discovering the disparities, revise the labeling guidelines until they become consistent. Accuracy Accuracy is a measure of how close a label is to the Ground Truth. Ground truth data is a subset of training data labeled by a knowledge expert or data scientist to test annotator accuracy. Benchmarks datasets are used to assess accuracy. Benchmarks allow data scientists to determine the overall quality of their data and then explore and resolve any potential drops in quality by offering insight into labelers' accuracy. Review Review is another way to assure correctness in the data. Following the completion of the labels, an expert assesses the annotations done by the labelers. Typically, the review is done by visually spot-checking labels; however other projects review all labels. Review is used to identify low-accuracy and inconsistencies in the labeling process, whereas benchmarks are commonly used to gauge labeler performance. Impact of noisy data The impact of noisy data varies based on the quantity of data and the use case. For instance, if the dataset size is small, noisy data is much more, whereas more extensive datasets would average the noisy labels. Furthermore, for critical use cases like medical image analysis, a small amount of noisy data can lead to significant errors during model training. MLOps MLOps (synonymous with DevOps for AI) is crucial for the improvement and maintenance of AI systems. The aggregation, maintenance, and improvement of data for training a model is a task of an MLOps engineer. Contrary to traditional software systems, AI systems have a feedback loop for constantly improving the data and code to improve overall design accuracy. The most important task of the MLOps team is to provide high-quality data at all phases of the AI project. The data-centric approach emphasizes improving the quality of data before focusing on the model architecture-specific details. When the good data is clearly defined, covers all corner cases, receives quick feedback from production, and is scaled appropriately. It is expected that the AI community would create MLOps tools to aid in the creation of high-quality datasets and accurate AI systems. The “data before code” approach is the right way to train and improve supervised AI systems. Images' Source: Andrew Ng, Deeplearning.ai",

    "title": "Web 3.0, NFTs & AI art. Researchers Asked an Advanced AI Whether AI Could Ever Be Ethical, and It Said NO",
    "headline": "Web 3.0 and NFTs are dominating the tech news these days, you all have heard about crazy amounts paid for art pieces that might not look so impressive from the technical perspective.",
    "post_text": "Web 3.0 and NFTs are dominating the tech news these days, you all have heard about crazy amounts paid for art pieces that might not look so impressive from the technical perspective. Also, many artists are using AI to generate some unique art pieces which makes it more interesting for me. So what is NFT? Non-Fungible just means that you can’t interchange one asset from another. A token in the case of NFTs is just a certificate of authenticity that sits on a blockchain — which makes the token verifiable and visible to everyone. Thus, an NFT is a unique digital asset in the forms of art, videos, audio, and any other form of digital creations. Why they are interesting? On the collecting side, easily navigable online platforms invite a younger generation into the art world by opening up an alternate, less intimidating, and transparent market. For artists, the technology promises to protect the uniqueness and provenance of work , therein preventing forgeries which promise to also benefit galleries and collectors. In addition, artists create smart contracts for NFTs through which they can guarantee royalties from future sales — 10 percent is the industry standard — revenue that creatives are currently cut out from under the existing auction house system. NFTs are to be used for practical governance use cases like copyright and general storage of sensitive, social information that would otherwise be too prone to abuse in the hands of centralized authorities that increasingly demonstrate contempt for the public. Records such as voter tallies, census information, titles of ownership, and medical records may be able to find protection within an NFT framework that is publicly owned. The future of NFTs goes far beyond social status, memes or multimillion-dollar works of art turned profile pictures. This is just the beginning of a global revolution that started out disrupting banking and is now going to disrupt everything else. If you are flipping NFTs and making some money, good on you but 98% of NFTs in 2021 will be a bad investment. It's only a matter of time before most of the NFT artworks will lose their allure to all but a small group of enthusiasts. As Gary Vee mentioned a couple of times the “ NFT winter” is coming soon. He predicted that a coming NFT crash is being driven by “short-term greed and supply and demand issues.” We have to get past the hype and controversy first and see NFTs for what they are which is much more than profile pics. I will cover this topic more in the next issue, let me know what do you think in the comments. [LinkedIn Post] The AI-powered “Animated Drawings” allows children to convert two-dimensional drawings into fun animations. [Amazon] Amazon presents a new method for \"debugging\" machine learning models: Synthetic data produced by perturbing test inputs identify error classes and provide additional data for retraining. [Fierce] Artificial intelligence programs to help power its on-demand blood sugar sensors: Know Labs has spun out a new AI-focused company to explore the substantial data they generate—including their use in a potentially novel revenue stream. [Futurism] RESEARCHERS ASKED AN ADVANCED AI WHETHER AI COULD EVER BE ETHICAL, AND IT SAID NO [NewScientits] AI writes better stories when it works backward from an ending: AI can write a story where each sentence flows from the next in a grammatically correct, statistically likely way, but often the plot will quickly descend into incoherence. Starting with a good ending and working backward results in better stories. [BBC] AI argues for and against itself in Oxford Union debate: the debate, was developed by the Applied Deep Research team at computer chip firm Nvidia and based on earlier work by Google. It was given access to a huge range of data - including the whole of Wikipedia, 63 million English news articles from 2016 to 2019, and 38 gigabytes worth of Reddit chat. [UArizona] Algorithms are Making Many of Your Decisions – and You Might be OK With That: A new study by UArizona law professor Derek Bambauer suggests that most people are content to let big data-produced algorithms decide many – but not all – of their day-to-day decisions. [Google AI] Interpretable Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting: This is an attention-based DNN model for multi-horizon forecasting. TFT is designed to explicitly align the model with the general multi-horizon forecasting task for both superior accuracy and interpretability, which they demonstrate across various use cases. [Nature] DeepMind AI tackles one of chemistry’s most valuable techniques: Machine-learning algorithm predicts material properties using electron density. [MIT] Nonsense can make sense to machine-learning models: Deep-learning methods confidently recognize images that are nonsense, a potential problem for medical and autonomous-driving decisions. This could be particularly worrisome for high-stakes environments, like split-second decisions for self-driving cars, and medical diagnostics for diseases that need more immediate attention. [Paper] Restore your old photos perfectly using AI: It leverages the generative face prior in a pre-trained GAN to restore realistic faces while preserving fidelity. Blind face restoration aims at recovering high-quality faces from the low-quality counterparts suffering from unknown degradation, such as low-resolution, noise, blur, compression artifacts, etc. [Nvidia]: Physics-ML Predicts Extreme Weather Globally in 0.25 Seconds [🎓] What is Git?

All conventional questions are biased by the needs of the Asker, according to the Asker's intent/goal, their word choices, the sequence the words are pose in. Obviously, with this level of bias mixed with the generally 'biased' nature of the database of answers (biased around data, not criteria, for example) makes for ingrained bias. I've invented a new form of question (took me 10 years) that enables users to access their criteria-based answers from where they're stored in their neural circuits, making it possible to avoid bias. I\"m just starting the process of developing FacilitationAI - an API that formulates and prompts a sequence of these brain-directional questions that will lead users to their values-based criteria for decision making. In other words, the output will be self-generated sequences of Facilitative Questions, not data.",

    "post_text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) used to be thought of as an idealistic technology that can only exist in sci-fi movies. Contrasting to the belief, today the technology has become so mature in a short tenure that all major companies are using it to their advantage. AI has become a major catalyst in driving the next revolution. The rate of progress in the field of artificial intelligence is exponentially increasing and impacting our lives like never before. From self-driving cars to robots replacing our jobs, everything seemed like a distant reality is within our vision. For all those reasons( and more ), many get interested in learning more about AI, but there are some barriers to learning this shiny topic. Information overload and too much noise are major reasons that I decided to start this series. I am going to share some easy-to-understand free resources and guidelines to help those who are new to this topic. No one can become an AI expert in 40 days, yet by following the pathway and keep practicing you will gain have enough knowledge and skills to become successful. This article is going to be the repository of my posts and will be updated daily, please like and share if you found it helpful. Day 1, the kick-off live broadcast. I just announce my plans and talked a bit about different roles in the AI world. ( Data Analyst - Data Scientist - Data engineer - Machine learning Engineer) Day 2 , we are starting with some important stuff. The foundation, the legendary PYTHON. Day 3 , from a coder to a software (AI) engineer you need to know more than the Syntax. Data structure and Algorithms are crucial down the line. Day 4, 4 libraries essential to start with Python: Day 5, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in python relies on the concept of classes and objects. Day 6, some other fundamental materials which are not as popular but are as important! Maths and Stats! Day 7, some top GitHub repos for you to explore some projects, read and replicate some codes. Day 8, there are around 10 types of databases based on the application requirements. I would recommend you to learn and practice using at least two major types of databases ( Relational and NoSQL ). Day 9, data visualization can be essential to strategic communication: it helps us interpret available data; detect patterns, trends, and anomalies; make decisions, and analyze inherent processes. Day 10, still about Data Visualization and Storytelling. Top 4 python data visualization libraries: Day 11, 5 types of Machine Learning Algorithms! Day 12, live about the \"40 Days of AI\". Day 13, supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms! Day 14 , Some refresher cheat sheets : Algebra and Calculus: Probabilities and statistics: Day 15 , Machine Learning Cheatsheets: Supervised Learning: Unsupervised Learning: Tips: Day16, some advanced Machine Learning topics! Day 17, Implementation of different machine learning algorithms written in Python. Day 18, t he accuracy is not accurate! Day 19, Reinforcement learning! Day 20, Self-supervised learning! Day 21, 10 Distance Measures in Data Science Day 22, E xcel is the one I use the most among the 4! Day 23, a comprehensive VIP Matplotlib cheatsheet. Day 24, Federated learning! Day 25, Machine Learning Course by Microsoft Day 26, Deep Learning by Andrew Ng Day 27, One of the most comprehensive Deep Learning books in 2021 Day 28, Convolutional Neural Networks. Day 29, Some Deep Learning Cheatsheets: Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks: Deep Learning Tips and Tricks: Day 30: Natural Language Processing Day 31: Interviews with Data Science Professionals Day 32: Generative Adversarial Networks Day 33: Knowing and using cloud services are crucial for all Data professionals.

    "title": "Diversity And Inclusion In AI",
    "headline": "Due to the advent of the Industrial Revolution and the advancement of computer technology, we have seen a drastic change in the way we have lived over the past few decades. Our lives revolve around technology, and it is becoming more pervasive every year.",
    "post_text": "Due to the advent of the Industrial Revolution and the advancement of computer technology, we have seen a drastic change in the way we have lived over the past few decades. Our lives revolve around technology, and it is becoming more pervasive every year. Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a major catalyst in driving the next revolution. The rate of progress in the field of artificial intelligence is exponentially increasing and impacting our lives like never before. From self-driving cars to robots replacing our jobs, everything that seemed like a distant reality is within our vision. However, whenever such a revolutionary technology arises, there are consequences. One major debate revolving around AI is about inclusion and diversity in the systems that impact millions of people from all backgrounds. Artificial intelligence used to be thought of as an idealistic technology that can only exist in sci-fi movies. Contrasting to the belief, today the technology has become so mature in a short tenure that all major companies are using it to their advantage. On one side, it presents immense opportunities, whereas on the other side, there is a growing concern about the fairness of these AI systems. So what role do diversity and inclusion play in AI? AI systems are built on learning from data, and if the data is skewed as per the view of the person building it, it can have major consequences. Furthermore, AI is already around us in places you might not be aware of. For instance, the surveillance cameras in many countries already have sophisticated AI technology that evaluates every second of the movement of the citizens. If there is implicit bias in the system, it can be unjust to some people. Diversity holds great importance because we want to make sure that when an AI system makes a call, it will be able to make accurate decisions. The main purpose for creating a fair system that will make very important decisions will go away if we allow personal bias to influence the development of the system. Major companies like Google , Facebook and Microsoft have diversity and inclusion programs in place, but are they really maintaining a diverse set of people building systems for their billions of users? An AI Now study revealed that women make up only 15% of AI researchers at Facebook and just 10% at Google. The study also found that less than 5% of the staff at Facebook, Google and Microsoft are Black, while Black workers in the U.S. as a whole make represent roughly 12% of the workforce. Due to the lack of diverse engineers and researchers, the products that are developed and used by billions of users may result in the propagation of bias on a large scale. Hence, inclusion and diversity in AI are crucial. The researcher group also noticed that the lack of diversity in academia is troublesome for the future of AI. In 2015, just 18% of the majors in computer science at U.S. universities were women, down from 37% in 1984. The researchers note, however, that efforts to overcome the pipeline problem — the theory that men are employed at disproportionate rates because there are not enough women to hire — do not fix structural imbalances of power at the workplace. This loop has caused the imbalance of equality principles necessary to build an unbiased product. As these are going to lay the foundations of futuristic technologies like AI, it is vital to address the issues of fairness at the earliest possible juncture. In an informative conversation between data scientist Cathy O'Neil and Salesforce Architect of Ethical AI Practice Kathy Baxter, they discuss human-centered AI and the norm of having a feedback loop from people of various perspectives, backgrounds and lifestyles into the design of AI systems. The preconceived notion is that the role of algorithms is \"to rectify the biases that humans possess.” This follows the assumption that AI systems can simply come into our lives and help us make better decisions — and I believe we should avoid such assumptions. With the increasing role that AI plays in business processes, the production of goods and the products themselves, the lack of diversity in AI and the invisibility of people of color will become a cascade of crises, with problems piled on one another if these biases are not tackled soon. We have seen companies issue moratoriums on the selling of facial recognition software that has long been accused of having built-in gender and racial bias . If these issues are not addressed soon, there will be a lot of consequences, especially for minorities. Today, the prowess of mass consumer software lies in the hands of the few giant software companies. These companies control and drive the development of products that will impact a majority of the world’s population. Technology is altering lifestyle and human behavior that is beyond our control. AI has the ability to develop self-driving cars, robots that talk to us and much more. Therefore, diversity in AI is necessary to avoid bias in the roots of these systems. The actual problem is polarizing and systemic, and it demands inclusion and true ownership.",

Therefore, diversity in AI is necessary to avoid bias in the roots of these systems. The actual problem is polarizing and systemic, and it demands inclusion and true ownership.</p>",

    "title": "The Role Of Bias In Artificial Intelligence",

    "post_text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved exponentially, from driverless vehicles to voice automation in households, and is no longer just a term from sci-fi books and movies. The future of artificial intelligence comes sooner than the projections that were seen in the futuristic Minority Report film. AI will become an essential part of our lives in the next few years, approaching the level of super-intelligent computers that transcend human analytical abilities. Imagine opening your car by coming near it or getting products delivered to your place via drones; AI can make it all a reality. However, recent discussions about the algorithmic bias reflect the loopholes in the \"so perfect\" AI systems. The lack of fairness that results from the performance of a computer system is algorithmic bias. In algorithmic bias, the lack of justice mentioned comes in different ways but can be interpreted as one group's prejudice based on a particular categorical distinction. Human bias is an issue that has been well researched in psychology for years. It arises from the implicit association that reflects bias we are not conscious of and how it can affect an event's outcomes. Over the last few years, society has begun to grapple with exactly how much these human prejudices, with devastating consequences, can find their way through AI systems. Being profoundly aware of these threats and seeking to minimize them is an urgent priority when many firms are looking to deploy AI solutions. Algorithmic bias in AI systems can take varied forms such as gender bias, racial prejudice and age discrimination. The critical question to ask is: What is the root cause for introducing bias in AI systems, and how can it be prevented? In numerous forms, bias may infiltrate algorithms. Even if sensitive variables such as gender, ethnicity or sexual identity are excluded, AI systems learn to make decisions based on training data, which may contain skewed human decisions or represent historical or social inequities. The role of data imbalance is vital in introducing bias. For instance, in 2016, Microsoft released an AI-based conversational chatbot on Twitter that was supposed to interact with people through tweets and direct messages. However, it started replying with highly offensive and racist messages within a few hours of its release. The chatbot was trained on anonymous public data and had a built-in internal learning feature, which led to a coordinated attack by a group of people to introduce racist bias in the system. Some users were able to inundate the bot with misogynistic, racist, and anti-Semitic language. This incident was an eye-opener to a broader audience of the potential negative implications of unfair algorithmic bias in the AI systems. Facial recognition systems are also under scrutiny. The class imbalance is a leading issue in facial recognition software. A dataset called \"Faces in the Wild,\" considered the benchmark for testing facial recognition software, had data that was 70% male and 80% white. Although it might be good enough to be used on lower-quality pictures, \"in the wild\" is a highly debatable topic. Concerns are arising as to how to test facial recognition technologies transparently. On June 30, 2020, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in New York City called for the cessation of private and government use of facial recognition technologies due to \"clear bias based on ethnic, racial, gender and other human characteristics.\" The ACM said that the bias caused \"profound injury, particularly to the lives, livelihoods and fundamental rights of individuals in specific demographic groups.\" Due to the pervasive nature of AI, it is crucial to address the algorithmic bias issues to make the systems more fair and inclusive. Apart from algorithms and data, researchers and engineers developing these systems are also responsible for AI bias. According to VentureBeat, a Columbia University study found that \"the more homogenous the [engineering] team is, the more likely it is that a given prediction error will appear.\" This can create a lack of empathy for the people who face problems of discrimination, leading to an unconscious introduction of bias in these algorithmic-savvy AI systems. The hidden use of AI systems in our society can be dangerous for marginalized people. Consequently, people don't have the option to opt-out of these AI systems' biased surveillance. Countries like the U.S. and China have deployed thousands of cameras , and the AI-enabled cameras track the movements of the people without their consent. It undermines those discriminated against, and it can also mitigate individuals' willingness to partake in the economy and culture. By promoting distrust and delivering distorted outcomes, it lowers the potential of AI for industry and society. Company and corporate executives need to ensure that human decision-making is strengthened by the AI technologies they use. They are responsible for supporting scientific advancement and standards that can minimize AI bias. Joy Buolamwini, a postgraduate researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, realizes the repercussions of algorithmic bias in our society, and to address it, she founded the Algorithmic Justice League. The organization's primary goal is to highlight the social and cultural implications of AI bias using art and scientific research. The work of such organizations will be monumental in addressing obscure issues like AI bias. Along with scientific researchers, governments have to join forces to address the AI bias problem toward a more progressive and fair society. In seeking to explain AI and science in general, one must determine the global societal complexities because most of the fundamental transition emerges at the social level.",

    "post_text": "As we are in the midst of an AI revolution, and the technology already has many different proven applications across industries like healthcare, automotive, banking oil and gas, and finance and transportation. There are several fields under the AI umbrella, including one of the most rapidly evolving fields today – Computer Vision Everything you want to know about Computer Vision One of the most powerful and compelling types of Artificial Intelligence is computer vision which you’ve almost surely experienced in any number of ways without even knowing. Here is a look at what it is, how it works, and why it is so awesome (and is only going to get better). Computer vision is the field of computer science that focuses on replicating parts of the complexity of the human visual system and enabling computers to identify and process objects in images and videos in the same way that humans do. Until recently, computer vision only worked in a limited capacity. But, Thanks to advances in artificial intelligence and innovations in deep learning and neural networks, the field has been able to take great leaps in recent years and has been able to surpass humans in some tasks related to detecting and labeling objects. One of the driving factors behind the growth of computer vision is the amount of data we generate today that is then used to train and make computer vision better. Along with a tremendous amount of visual data (more than 3 billion images are shared online every day), the computing power required to analyze the data is now accessible. As the field of computer vision has grown with new hardware and algorithms so has the accuracy rates for object identification. In less than a decade, today’s systems have reached 99 percent accuracy from 50 percent making them more accurate than humans at quickly reacting to visual inputs How Does Computer Vision Work? One of the major open questions in both Neuroscience and Machine Learning is: How exactly do our brains work, and how can we approximate that with our own algorithms? The reality is that there are very few working and comprehensive theories of brain computation; so even though Neural Nets are supposed to “mimic the way the brain works,” nobody is quite sure if that’s actually true. The same paradox holds for computer vision - since we are not decided on how the brain and eyes process images, it is difficult to say how well the algorithms used in production approximate our own internal mental processes. On a certain level, Computer vision is all about pattern recognition. So one way to train a computer how to understand visual data is to feed it images, lots of images thousands, millions if possible that have been labeled, and then subject those to various software techniques, or algorithms, that allows the computer to hunt down patterns in all the elements that relate to those labels. Leveraging Computer Vision to Businesses Computer vision is enabling a multitude of industries like retail, insurance, manufacturing, etc. to achieve enhanced customer delight and satisfaction. Currently, Organizations leveraging AI philosophy compels us to empower businesses to provide better services to their customers. How Computer Vision Applications can be leveraged in the BFSI Sector Applying computer vision techniques can also resolve some longstanding challenges of the BFSI industry and deliver key benefits in areas like cybersecurity, customer experience management, sentiment analysis, and customer identification and authentication. There are several use cases across retail banking, commercial banking, and insurance where the adoption of computer vision can reimagine the business and create exponential value. Retail Banking: The scope for adopting computer vision in retail banking is huge. Furthermore, it has the potential to deliver immense business benefits across cost and efficiency optimization and customer experience. Security and fraud control Using computer vision techniques like facial recognition and biometric authentication can help banks improve security and better combat fraud. CaxiaBank allows its customers to use facial recognition technology to draw cash from its ATMs improving user experience and enhancing security. KYC processing and onboarding Computer vision can enhance Know Your Customer (KYC) processing by enabling banks to effectively search and match customer pictures to identify adverse media reporting and negative information on the web and social media. Also, KYC processing, onboarding, mortgage, credit card initiation, loan origination, and many other tasks are paper-based and require manual effort to scan, store, classify, and extract data often resulting in errors and adverse impact on process efficiency. Computer vision can help automate document classification and data extraction processes to enhance efficiency and accuracy. Smarter branches Computer vision can help banks improve the in-branch experience. For instance, customers can be identified as they walk into the branch by comparing their image from the camera positioned at the entry point with the image in the records. With the aid of insights gained from analytics, banks can predict the reason for the customer’s visit to the branch and proactively deliver personalized and contextual service while also identifying opportunities for cross-selling and up-sell. Besides, analyzing customer sentiments (facial expressions) as they interact with the branch personnel can yield valuable insights to improve service and experience. Computer vision backed analysis of images and videos (facial expression, activity pattern) can flag potentially fraudulent activities like card skimming, theft, and so on. Commercial Banking Commercial banks have traditionally used OCR software to automate document classification and data extraction from scanned documents. The existing OCR system works on rules and templates and has a long training process because each variation needs to be trained and configured afresh. Even a slight deviation in the templates might potentially result in exceptions or compromise accuracy in data extraction. A large multinational bank could achieve less than 70% accuracy in data extraction using OCR even after many years due to huge variations in the documents received from multiple entities. Opting for computer vision-based OCR tools such as Amazon Rekognition, Google’s Vision API, and Azure Computer Vision that can ‘read’ unstructured documents in varying templates and automate document classification, data extraction, and processing will significantly increase the accuracy levels. Insurance Use cases for computer vision adoption abound in the insurance industry as well. For instance, in property and casualty insurance, computer vision can help insurance companies remotely analyze images of properties to access granular details such as the condition of the exterior and so on at the time of underwriting thereby drastically reducing the need for physical inspection. Depending on these aspects, insurers can offer differentiated premiums to customers. For damage claims, based on the image of the damaged goods, insurers can leverage computer vision to remotely extract granular details from images and estimate the damage value using machine learning algorithms. Let us talk about some integral computer vision solutions that can be leveraged for customers Facial Recognition System Every retail store has cameras for security reasons. These cameras can be used to recognize faces and identify frequent customers and new customers. This identification can help retailers to give discounts to increase brand loyalty and to attract new customers. The simplest way of attracting new customers is by providing them with the most suitable recommendations for their purchase history. To put this to use building an in-house solution using computer vision algorithms that registers faces of people in the system. When the same person visits the store, he/she gets recognized by the system Reverse Image Search Customers often come across something that they want to buy, but somehow; do not have relevant information about it. Object recognition technology can be used to recognize such products and provide contextual information about them. It can also direct the user to the same/similar product. ‘Try an image search’ option has got wide acceptance by customers in many popular eCommerce sites. Insurance Claim Processing in Insurance is a time-consuming process and relies a lot on human intervention. After a claim has been filed, a human adjuster visits the workshop (in case of asset damage) or the place where the damage occurred (in case of a home insurance) to inspect the damage, validate claim and coverage, evaluate the claim amount and approve payment followed by the finance department initiating payment. Computer vision can play a vital role in eliminating the roadblocks in faster processing of claims by doing automatic damage detection and assessment. Car Damage Assessment The claim processing for car damage by doing auto-detection of damaged parts and auto-assessment of the severity of damage to estimate the claim amount. The user can log in using his/her credentials on the app. The details of the user such as name, policy number, and vehicle number get populated from the guidewire. The user can then use the photo claim option to take pictures of damaged cars. The AI engine analyzes those images, identifies the damaged parts of the car, and assesses the severity of the damage. Based on this assessment, the claim amount is evaluated. If the user is satisfied with the estimates, he/she can submit the claim for processing to the guidewire. Roof Damage Assessment This solution is a part of the home insurance claim processing and identifies the part of the roof which is damaged due to hailstorms or any other natural calamity. The pictures are taken using drones and assessed using computer vision algorithms. Manufacturing Quality assurance is the most expensive activity in production and manual inspections are carried out for the same. Computer vision makes it possible to spot minor defects that are not visible to the human eye. According to Forbes, AI can improve manufacturing defect detection rate by 90%. Surface Imperfection Detection is a quality assurance task that is mandatory to guarantee the quality of a manufactured item. Steel Defect Identification Defect Identification on steel sheets is one such step in reducing the manual efforts in quality check. Surface defects on steel sheets are not identifiable by human eyes and require the use of high-frequency cameras to detect the same. We have built a solution to localize and classify those defects into four categories using computer vision algorithms. Self-Driving Cars Computer vision enables self-driving cars to make sense of their surroundings. Cameras capture video from different angles around the car and feed it to computer vision software, which then processes the images in real-time to find the extremities of roads, read traffic signs, detect other cars, objects, and pedestrians. The self-driving car can then steer its way on streets and highways, avoid hitting obstacles, and (hopefully) safely drive its passengers to their destination. Healthcare Computer vision has also been an important part of advances in health-tech. Computer vision algorithms can help automate tasks such as detecting cancerous moles in skin images or finding symptoms in x-ray and MRI scans. Augmented Reality & Mixed Reality Computer vision also plays an important role in augmented and mixed reality, the technology that enables computing devices such as smartphones, tablets, and smart glasses to overlay and embed virtual objects on real world imagery. Using computer vision, AR gear detects objects in the real world to determine the locations on a device’s display to place a virtual object. For instance, computer vision algorithms can help AR applications detect planes such as tabletops, walls, and floors, a very important part of establishing depth and dimensions and placing virtual objects in the physical world",

Until recently, computer vision only worked in a limited capacity.</p><p>But, Thanks to advances in artificial intelligence and innovations in deep learning and neural networks, the field has been able to take great leaps in recent years and has been able to surpass humans in some tasks related to detecting and labeling objects.</p><p>One of the driving factors behind the growth of computer vision is the amount of data we generate today that is then used to train and make computer vision better.</p><p>Along with a tremendous amount of visual data (more than 3 billion images are shared online every day), the computing power required to analyze the data is now accessible. As the field of computer vision has grown with new hardware and algorithms so has the accuracy rates for object identification. In less than a decade, today&#x2019;s systems have reached 99 percent accuracy from 50 percent making them more accurate than humans at quickly reacting to visual inputs</p><p><strong>How Does Computer Vision Work?</strong></p><p>One of the major open questions in both Neuroscience and Machine Learning is: How exactly do our brains work, and how can we approximate that with our own algorithms? The reality is that there are very few working and comprehensive theories of brain computation; so even though Neural Nets are supposed to &#x201C;mimic the way the brain works,&#x201D; nobody is quite sure if that&#x2019;s actually true.</p><p>The same paradox holds for computer vision - since we are not decided on how the brain and eyes process images, it is difficult to say how well the algorithms used in production approximate our own internal mental processes.</p><p>On a certain level, Computer vision is all about pattern recognition. So one way to train a computer how to understand visual data is to feed it images, lots of images thousands, millions if possible that have been labeled, and then subject those to various software techniques, or algorithms, that allows the computer to hunt down patterns in all the elements that relate to those labels.</p><p><strong>Leveraging Computer Vision to Businesses</strong></p><p>Computer vision is enabling a multitude of industries like retail, insurance, manufacturing, etc. to achieve enhanced customer delight and satisfaction. Currently, Organizations leveraging AI philosophy compels us to empower businesses to provide better services to their customers.</p><p><strong>How Computer Vision Applications can be leveraged in the BFSI Sector</strong></p><p>Applying computer vision techniques can also resolve some longstanding challenges of the BFSI industry and deliver key benefits in areas like cybersecurity, customer experience management, sentiment analysis, and customer identification and authentication. There are several use cases across retail banking, commercial banking, and insurance where the adoption of computer vision can reimagine the business and create exponential value.</p><p><strong>Retail Banking:</strong> The scope for adopting computer vision in retail banking is huge. Furthermore, it has the potential to deliver immense business benefits across cost and efficiency optimization and customer experience.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Security and fraud control&#xA0;</strong></p><p>Using computer vision techniques like facial recognition and biometric authentication can help banks improve security and better combat fraud. CaxiaBank allows its customers to use facial recognition technology to draw cash from its ATMs improving user experience and enhancing security.</p><p><strong>KYC processing and onboarding&#xA0;</strong></p><p>Computer vision can enhance Know Your Customer (KYC) processing by enabling banks to effectively search and match customer pictures to identify adverse media reporting and negative information on the web and social media. Also, KYC processing, onboarding, mortgage, credit card initiation, loan origination, and many other tasks are paper-based and require manual effort to scan, store, classify, and extract data often resulting in errors and adverse impact on process efficiency. Computer vision can help automate document classification and data extraction processes to enhance efficiency and accuracy.</p><p><strong>Smarter branches&#xA0;</strong></p><p>Computer vision can help banks improve the in-branch experience. For instance, customers can be identified as they walk into the branch by comparing their image from the camera positioned at the entry point with the image in the records. With the aid of insights gained from analytics, banks can predict the reason for the customer&#x2019;s visit to the branch and proactively deliver personalized and contextual service while also identifying opportunities for cross-selling and up-sell. Besides, analyzing customer sentiments (facial expressions) as they interact with the branch personnel can yield valuable insights to improve service and experience. Computer vision backed analysis of images and videos (facial expression, activity pattern) can flag potentially fraudulent activities like card skimming, theft, and so on.</p><p><strong>Commercial Banking&#xA0;</strong></p><p>Commercial banks have traditionally used OCR software to automate document classification and data extraction from scanned documents. The existing OCR system works on rules and templates and has a long training process because each variation needs to be trained and configured afresh. Even a slight deviation in the templates might potentially result in exceptions or compromise accuracy in data extraction. A large multinational bank could achieve less than 70% accuracy in data extraction using OCR even after many years due to huge variations in the documents received from multiple entities. Opting for computer vision-based OCR tools such as Amazon Rekognition, Google&#x2019;s Vision API, and Azure Computer Vision that can &#x2018;read&#x2019; unstructured documents in varying templates and automate document classification, data extraction, and processing will significantly increase the accuracy levels.</p><p><strong>Insurance</strong></p><p>&#xA0;Use cases for computer vision adoption abound in the insurance industry as well. For instance, in property and casualty insurance, computer vision can help insurance companies remotely analyze images of properties to access granular details such as the condition of the exterior and so on at the time of underwriting thereby drastically reducing the need for physical inspection. Depending on these aspects, insurers can offer differentiated premiums to customers. For damage claims, based on the image of the damaged goods, insurers can leverage computer vision to remotely extract granular details from images and estimate the damage value using machine learning algorithms.</p><p><strong>Let us talk about some integral computer vision solutions that can be leveraged for customers</strong></p><p><strong>Facial Recognition System</strong></p><p>Every retail store has cameras for security reasons. These cameras can be used to recognize faces and identify frequent customers and new customers. This identification can help retailers to give discounts to increase brand loyalty and to attract new customers. The simplest way of attracting new customers is by providing them with the most suitable recommendations for their purchase history. To put this to use building an in-house solution using computer vision algorithms that registers faces of people in the system. When the same person visits the store, he/she gets recognized by the system</p><p><strong>Reverse Image Search</strong></p><p>Customers often come across something that they want to buy, but somehow; do not have relevant information about it. Object recognition technology can be used to recognize such products and provide contextual information about them. It can also direct the user to the same/similar product. &#x2018;Try an image search&#x2019; option has got wide acceptance by customers in many popular eCommerce sites.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Insurance</strong></p><p>Claim Processing in Insurance is a time-consuming process and relies a lot on human intervention. After a claim has been filed, a human adjuster visits the workshop (in case of asset damage) or the place where the damage occurred (in case of a home insurance) to inspect the damage, validate claim and coverage, evaluate the claim amount and approve payment followed by the finance department initiating payment.</p><p>Computer vision can play a vital role in eliminating the roadblocks in faster processing of claims by doing automatic damage detection and assessment.</p><p><strong>Car Damage Assessment</strong></p><p>The claim processing for car damage by doing auto-detection of damaged parts and auto-assessment of the severity of damage to estimate the claim amount. The user can log in using his/her credentials on the app. The details of the user such as name, policy number, and vehicle number get populated from the guidewire. The user can then use the photo claim option to take pictures of damaged cars. The AI engine analyzes those images, identifies the damaged parts of the car, and assesses the severity of the damage. Based on this assessment, the claim amount is evaluated. If the user is satisfied with the estimates, he/she can submit the claim for processing to the guidewire.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Roof Damage Assessment</strong></p><p>This solution is a part of the home insurance claim processing and identifies the part of the roof which is damaged due to hailstorms or any other natural calamity. The pictures are taken using drones and assessed using computer vision algorithms.</p><p><strong>Manufacturing</strong></p><p>Quality assurance is the most expensive activity in production and manual inspections are carried out for the same. Computer vision makes it possible to spot minor defects that are not visible to the human eye. According to Forbes, AI can improve manufacturing defect detection rate by 90%. Surface Imperfection Detection is a quality assurance task that is mandatory to guarantee the quality of a manufactured item.</p><p><strong>Steel Defect Identification</strong></p><p>Defect Identification on steel sheets is one such step in reducing the manual efforts in quality check. Surface defects on steel sheets are not identifiable by human eyes and require the use of high-frequency cameras to detect the same. We have built a solution to localize and classify those defects into four categories using computer vision algorithms.</p><p><strong>Self-Driving Cars</strong></p><p>Computer vision enables self-driving cars to make sense of their surroundings. Cameras capture video from different angles around the car and feed it to computer vision software, which then processes the images in real-time to find the extremities of roads, read traffic signs, detect other cars, objects, and pedestrians. The self-driving car can then steer its way on streets and highways, avoid hitting obstacles, and (hopefully) safely drive its passengers to their destination.</p><p><strong>Healthcare</strong></p><p>Computer vision has also been an important part of advances in health-tech. Computer vision algorithms can help automate tasks such as detecting cancerous moles in skin images or finding symptoms in x-ray and MRI scans.</p><p><strong>Augmented Reality &amp; Mixed Reality</strong></p><p>Computer vision also plays an important role in augmented and mixed reality, the technology that enables computing devices such as smartphones, tablets, and smart glasses to overlay and embed virtual objects on real world imagery. Using computer vision, AR gear detects objects in the real world to determine the locations on a device&#x2019;s display to place a virtual object. For instance, computer vision algorithms can help AR applications detect planes such as tabletops, walls, and floors, a very important part of establishing depth and dimensions and placing virtual objects in the physical world&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>",

    "post_text": "The intelligent software paradigm is taking over surveillance due to the pervasive nature of self-learning capabilities emerging in the space. In a traditional sense, surveillance is following the movement of someone. Across the globe, governments have invested heavily in setting up a surveillance infrastructure. There are millions of cameras, but no one to monitor them 24/7. However, artificial intelligence (AI) can process every frame and present real-time analysis to save millions of lives. Numerous states are adopting sophisticated AI surveillance technologies to map, track and control people to meet various policy aims — some legitimate, some violating human rights and some of which fall into a gray area. The reason AI is making a vast impact is because of its self-learning capabilities. Initially, the computer learned to reason about objects of interest in the scene. Now, it detects the objects in the real world, matches the results with the correct annotations (provided by humans) and tries to improve further. This way, it is constantly learning and improving. Error is minimized with every iteration and moves closer to — or even better than — human error. Let's discuss a few critical problems in the surveillance space. Issues like people tracking, area monitoring, parking occupancy, vehicle analytics, and traffic monitoring are crucial. Amid the Covid-19 crisis, many companies have spent considerable effort in building AI-based systems to ensure social distancing in public areas. The pervasive nature of AI is leading to a level of sophistication that was unheard of a few years ago. For instance, for people tracking, video processing is done in real-time to analyze and identify suspicious events that can pose a security threat to an enterprise. Video analytics technology effectively allows surveillance software to reason and detect irregular behavior and identify dangerous activity that might be ignored by a person. Another exciting area where AI is making huge strides is in retail surveillance. Mega conglomerates like Fujitsu, Walmart, etc. have set up independent research labs to facilitate AI in behavioral analytics in their retail stores. For example, the software can identify a possible shooter and send real-time warnings to emergency responders to help mitigate the threats to teachers, personnel, and buildings. On the other hand, Amazon has taken AI to the next level by automating the end-to-end customer shopping experience. Amazon Go stores are fully powered with fusion sensors and cameras that detect what you pick. By the time you have finished collecting, your purchase is made without any intervention. These are just a few examples where private surveillance uses AI technology for business use cases. AI-based software helps narrow the attention span of the operators so they can focus on other crucial areas. Parameter safety, for instance, is an age-old problem that was untouched by technology until recently. AI helps detect anomalies like a person entering a restricted area or unusual behavior and reports it to the system. Another example is parking occupancy. While there are millions of parking lots globally, only a handful of them is automated. AI uses the surveillance data, checks whether a vehicle has paid the parking fee and allows it to enter the parking lot. Simultaneously, it provides statistical analysis about how many vehicles entered, how long they stayed, and much more. Consequently, AI is also revolutionizing the defense industry . Video monitoring software operated by AI helps decrease the amount of time spent on surveillance, allowing security operators to be more effective and successful in their work. AI technology enables operators to concentrate on what they do best by eliminating the need to continuously monitor video displays and automate the \"detection\" role of surveillance: verifying and acting on crucial incidents. Countries like the U.S. and China have deployed millions of cameras and are leading the AI-based surveillance market. According to the AIGS (Artificial Intelligence Global Surveillance) index, at least 75 out of 176 countries globally are actively using AI-based surveillance technologies. China is considered to be a significant player in AI-based surveillance, supplying AI-based technologies to at least 60 countries. Autocratic or semi-autocratic countries like Saudi Arabia, China, and Russia are exploiting AI-based technologies for mass surveillance purposes. At the same time, liberal governments are dismissing the idea of using it on the grounds of protecting privacy. The European Commission aims to strictly control AI to reduce risk, including a ban on \"black box\" AI programs (which humans cannot understand). The main objective is to develop the trust of the public and not cause chaos. AI appears to work in favor of humanity if used in ethical terms. The fundamental question that arises amid global privacy crises is whether these advancements are counterintuitive to humans. Globally, countries are working on the ethical norms of surveillance. As AI technology gets more powerful each year, it will become more essential to regulate it.",

China is considered to be a significant player in AI-based surveillance, supplying AI-based technologies to at least 60 countries.&#xA0;</p><p>Autocratic or semi-autocratic countries like Saudi Arabia, China, and Russia are exploiting AI-based technologies for mass surveillance purposes. At the same time, liberal governments are dismissing the idea of using it on the grounds of protecting privacy. The European Commission aims to strictly control AI to reduce risk, including a ban on &quot;black box&quot; AI programs (which humans cannot understand). The main objective is to develop the trust of the public and not cause chaos. AI appears to work in favor of humanity if used in ethical terms.&#xA0;</p><p>The fundamental question that arises amid global privacy crises is whether these advancements are counterintuitive to humans. Globally, countries are working on the ethical norms of surveillance. As AI technology gets more powerful each year, it will become more essential to regulate it.&#xA0;</p>",

    "headline": "By employing the right AI technology for your business, you can accelerate growth. But business leaders should not forcefully include AI in their operations; instead, they should find specific workflows in which AI can provide maximum value.",
    "post_text": "By employing the right AI technology for your business, you can accelerate growth. But business leaders should not forcefully include AI in their operations; instead, they should find specific workflows in which AI can provide maximum value. For instance, if you are in a restaurant business, you might want to use AI to generate weekly analytics by processing electronic bills. Many executives have a trust issue with up-and-coming technologies like AI regarding how they will fit into their business ecosystem. If you're interested in adopting AI but aren't sure whether or where it can fit into your business, below are steps to help kick-start the process of using it in your workflow. Identify the areas of your business where AI can provide maximum value. A business is a complex set of processes intertwined with one another that runs like a well-oiled machine, so integrating new technology into an existing workflow is not straightforward. Implementing AI comes at a cost, and thus, a value analysis is essential to make sure your investment gives you maximum return. First, understand the need for AI in your business. For instance, Domino's uses AI as part of its infrastructure to improve its pizza delivery. To find out whether your business can benefit from AI, ask yourself a few basic questions: • On what scale is your business digitized? Digitization in business involves converting a raw form of data to a digital format. This can include images, numbers, etc. Digitization can help a business to scale. For instance, if a shopkeeper is selling garments locally, then the business’s reach is limited to a specific demographic. On the contrary, if the shopkeeper decided to digitize by building a website, the business could reach out to more people, sell more garments and expand. One example of the potential benefits of digitization is Target, which saw its stock rise 66% over its 8-year digital transformation efforts. Digitization brings monetary benefits and helps track various critical areas of the business to reduce risks such as account settlement, finance management, inventory management, etc. One would require immense human resources to do all these tasks. AI is powerful when we provide it with the right amount of digitized data. The potential of AI lies in finding hidden patterns in data that are not obvious to a human. Hence, digitized data provides a vital role in transforming business using AI. If your company lacks digital data generation, it probably doesn't require AI in the first place. • What are the different forms of digital data that your company collects, and how do you store them? If AI is a car, then digital data is the fuel. • For the investment of time and money required, would AI provide a better return over time? Talk to your engineers to understand how AI can solve your business’s problems. Engineers bring a different perspective to your business challenges and can help with valuable suggestions. Consult with your in-house engineers to understand the scope of a particular problem and the time frame to solve it. It is crucial to take their advice before setting any commitments because they know the depth of the problem. They can also help you narrow the intended scope of AI in your business and then help you start the development process. Determine the implications of AI on your revenue model. For any business, revenue is a crucial indicator of growth. The identified use cases for AI and their expectations should be analyzed to ensure they do not limit growth in the long term. Understand the cost implications of AI on your business. AI is still in its growing phase. Every year, we see significant improvements and active research in AI. Despite that, it would be naive to consider it as a low-cost proposition. The cost implication depends on your use case, but it will not come at a low price. For instance, the internet was expensive during its developing phase. If your business can afford an AI-based solution that can provide a decent value proposition and increased efficiency, you should opt for it. Figure out whether AI will help your employees. Employees are central to the success of any organization. AI can automate workflows, improve decision-making and generate insights that can help employees focus on more complex tasks. For instance, in a call center, workers can benefit from AI handling simple language queries without human interference. It can also help in identifying and avoiding spam calls. Chatbots are another great example, which is a norm in the service industry these days. There are infinite possibilities where AI can help the workforce and not replace it. Consider the legal and ethical implications of implementing AI. Keep in mind that AI is an emerging technology. It is changing at a rapid pace and may pose some unexpected challenges and ethical concerns . There is an ongoing debate about the ethics of AI and on what level it should be regulated. You need to make sure your business is not affected by such external forces. Enhance your AI learning. A common misunderstanding about AI among business owners is that AI is capable of solving any problem with less or no human intervention. The current state of AI is nowhere near general intelligence. To realize the true value proposition of AI in your business, keep yourself up to date on current advancements in AI. Invest as little as possible initially, and try to get a working prototype ready. When testing an AI solution, set short-term milestones, and analyze the progress. It is essential to enhance your understanding of AI through this process and have confidence once you know its challenges. If you want to accelerate your business growth using AI, you should be willing to learn and adapt to changes quickly.",

    "post_text": "Computers back in the day were good at understanding numbers yet failed miserably at reasoning visual data. Over the years, many researchers and engineers have worked on the path of making computer reason better on the image data that humans perceived so naturally. The generation of image data increases at a rate of petabytes per minute, and humans cannot process it all. Hence, computer vision should be a crucial driver of intelligent technology in the coming years. Computer vision has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications in search, medicine, image understanding, apps, mapping, drones and self-driving cars. Core to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks, such as image classification, localization and detection. Recent research developments have significantly advanced the performance of these state-of-the-art optical recognition systems. Computer vision, a subdomain of artificial intelligence, is one of the most in-demand skills for jobs, according to LinkedIn. Every year, thousands of scientists contribute to it, and there has been an exponential rise in research work over the last decade. Computer vision technology should also drive some of the most exciting innovations of the 21st century, like autonomous vehicles, medical imaging diagnosis and military applications. Hence, it an excellent prospect for anyone looking for a well-paid career in an exciting and cutting-edge field. Given the wealth of education available online, you don't necessarily need an Ivy League education to learn computer vision. Kick-start your learning today with the best-in-class online courses to elevate your understanding of machine vision to the next level. These courses can cater to varied audiences. Maybe you want to learn how to design and code AI algorithms. Perhaps you want to mess around with the tools and frameworks that are available, or perhaps you need to understand the business side of computer vision in your company. Whatever your goals are, you are likely to find something that will expand your horizons. For example, Stanford offers a course called \"Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition\" that dives deep into details of the deep learning architectures focused on learning end-to-end models for these tasks, particularly image classification by the school's Vision Lab under the supervision of Fei Fei Li. During the 10 weeks, students learn to implement, train, and debug their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision. It focuses on teaching how to set up the problem of image recognition, the learning algorithms (e.g., backpropagation), practical engineering tricks for training, and fine-tuning the networks, and it guides the students through hands-on assignments and a final project. Course Mode: Online and Self Paced Duration: 10 weeks Certification: Not provided Price: Free Link: CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition There are elementary-level courses aimed at anyone who wants to play around with the nuts and bolts that go into building computer vision applications and what it can be used for without getting involved in the underlying mathematics and statistics. For instance, Computer Vision I by OpenCV teaches fundamental computer vision concepts, like image operations, image and video processing, deep learning and more using the OpenCV toolkit. It can help boost your hands-on understanding with an in-depth explanation of primitive code samples, and it also covers a wide range of real-world systems, like document scanner, human post estimation, selfie application and face detection, to name a few. You can also learn how to approach almost any computer vision task using the OpenCV framework. It has a collection of both image and video processing methods. Course Mode: Online and Self Paced Duration: 6 months of access after purchase Certification: Provided Price: ~ 249 USD (Available at a lower price if a bundle of courses purchased) Other courses can help you get things up and running and solve a problem without diving into theory. OpenCV's Computer Vision II covers a robust real-time object detection algorithm \"Yolo\" as a case study and how to implement Snapchat filters. If rapid prototyping interests you, it is worth the time. You should gain a considerable empirical understanding of building real-world applications using the techniques learned in the first part. In contrast to the above program, deep learning will be the main focus. Consequently, it teaches how to deploy a computer vision application on the web using AWS services. Course Mode: Online and Self Paced Duration: 6 months of access after purchase Certification: Provided Price: ~ 299 USD (Available at a lower price if a bundle of courses purchased) There are also courses designed for lovers of math and theory. For instance, world-renowned computer vision research institution Georgia Tech offers an \"Introduction to Computer Vision\" course that is less focused on the machine learning aspect of CV. The program avoids the use of high-level APIs and instead teaches low-level primitives to analyze the image and extract structural information. It heavily focuses on the fundamentals of computer vision with underlying mathematics behind it, along with a few applications like depth recovery from the stereo, camera calibration, image stabilization, automated alignment, tracking, and action recognition. Course Mode: Online and Self Paced Duration: Approx. 4 months Certification: Not Provided Price: Free Link: Introduction to Computer Vision by Georgia Tech Some courses, such as one from Udemy titled \"Deep Learning: Advanced Computer Vision,\" jump right into developing well-known computer vision models using artificial neural networks using APIs. These are perfect for those who have a decent Python programming experience and a good grasp of computer vision and deep learning fundamentals. No mathematic constraints are involved. You will learn advanced concepts in deep learning, like generative adversarial networks (GANs) and real-time object detectors, like single shot detector (SSD). You'll also apply transfer learning and grasp an understanding of state-of-the-art CNN architectures, like ResNet, Inception, VGG, etc. The focus is on how to use high-level APIs to build real-world AI systems. You should learn how to quickly prototype a working computer vision system using available tools and frameworks. Course Mode: Online and Self Paced Duration: 10 Hours on Demand (Lifetime access after purchase) Certification: Provided Price: ~ 200 AUD (at the time of writing) Lastly, there are courses for those who aren't novices and have a theoretical background of signal and systems and linear algebra. NPTEL 's \"Computer Vision\" course is taught by one of the oldest and prestigious IITs (Indian Institute of Technology) in India, taught by professors having more than two decades of experience in computer vision research. The program has some of the best explanations of signal processing fundamentals. Although not very interactive, it touches upon important aspects of image processing that you might not find in any other class. It teaches the fundamentals of 2D and 3D image processing techniques, color fundamentals, camera geometry, and sparse representation based on signal processing. Course Mode: Online and Self Paced (Videos) Duration: Approx. 12 Weeks Certification: Not Provided Price: Free Link: Computer Vision by NPTEL Online courses have democratized the power of computer vision, contributing to building a positive shared future for all. Take the plunge, learn from anywhere, and be at the frontier of vision technology.",

Over the years, many researchers and engineers have worked on the path of making computer reason better on the image data that humans perceived so naturally. The generation of image data increases at a rate of petabytes per minute, and humans cannot process it all. Hence, computer vision should be a crucial driver of intelligent technology in the coming years.</p><p>Computer vision has become ubiquitous in our society, with applications in search, medicine, image understanding, apps, mapping, drones and self-driving cars. Core to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks, such as image classification, localization and detection. Recent research developments have significantly advanced the performance of these state-of-the-art optical recognition systems.</p><p>Computer vision, a subdomain of artificial intelligence, is one of the&#xA0;<a href=\"https://learning.linkedin.com/blog/top-skills/the-skills-companies-need-most-in-2020and-how-to-learn-them\" target=\"_blank\">most in-demand skills</a>&#xA0;for jobs, according to LinkedIn. Every year, thousands of scientists contribute to it, and there has been an exponential&#xA0;<a href=\"https://yassouali.github.io/ml-blog/cvpr2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">rise in research</a>&#xA0;work over the last decade. Computer vision technology should also drive some of the most exciting innovations of the 21st century, like autonomous vehicles, medical imaging diagnosis and military applications.</p><p>Hence, it an excellent prospect for anyone looking for a well-paid career in an exciting and cutting-edge field. Given the wealth of education available online, you don&apos;t necessarily need an Ivy League education to learn computer vision. Kick-start your learning today with the best-in-class online courses to elevate your understanding of machine vision to the next level.</p><p>These courses can cater to varied audiences. Maybe you want to learn how to design and code AI algorithms. Perhaps you want to mess around with the tools and frameworks that are available, or perhaps you need to understand the business side of computer vision in your company. Whatever your goals are, you are likely to find something that will expand your horizons. </p><p>For example, <strong>Stanford </strong>offers a course called &quot;Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition&quot; that dives deep into details of the deep learning architectures focused on learning end-to-end models for these tasks, particularly image classification by the school&apos;s Vision Lab under the supervision of Fei Fei Li. During the 10 weeks, students learn to implement, train, and debug their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of cutting-edge research in computer vision. It focuses on teaching how to set up the problem of image recognition, the learning algorithms (e.g., backpropagation), practical engineering tricks for training, and fine-tuning the networks, and it guides the students through hands-on assignments and a final project.</p><p><strong>Course Mode: </strong>Online and Self Paced</p><p><strong>Duration: </strong>10 weeks</p><p><strong>Certification: </strong>Not provided</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Link: </strong><a href=\"http://cs231n.stanford.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition</a></p><p>There are elementary-level courses aimed at anyone who wants to play around with the nuts and bolts that go into building computer vision applications and what it can be used for without getting involved in the underlying mathematics and statistics. For instance, Computer Vision I by <strong>OpenCV</strong> teaches fundamental computer vision concepts, like image operations, image and video processing, deep learning and more using the OpenCV toolkit. It can help boost your hands-on understanding with an in-depth explanation of primitive code samples, and it also covers a wide range of real-world systems, like document scanner, human post estimation, selfie application and face detection, to name a few.

OpenCV&apos;s Computer Vision II covers a robust real-time object detection algorithm &quot;Yolo&quot; as a case study and how to implement Snapchat filters. If rapid prototyping interests you, it is worth the time. You should gain a considerable empirical understanding of building real-world applications using the techniques learned in the first part. In contrast to the above program, deep learning will be the main focus. Consequently, it teaches how to deploy a computer vision application on the web using AWS services.</p><div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-right\"><img alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C5612AQFRFSnqp0I2yQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1597066862828?e=1740009600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=Namr1Yv6UX2j5rGOJCI2Ui5LLRBF0d6ald4htxauC4I\" src=\"//:0\"></div><p><strong>Course Mode: </strong>Online and Self Paced</p><p><strong>Duration: </strong>6 months of access after purchase</p><p><strong>Certification: </strong>Provided</p><p><strong>Price: ~</strong>299 USD (Available at a lower price if a bundle of courses purchased)</p><p>There are also courses designed for lovers of math and theory. For instance, world-renowned computer vision research institution<strong> Georgia Tech</strong> offers an &quot;Introduction to Computer Vision&quot; course that is less focused on the machine learning aspect of CV. The program avoids the use of high-level APIs and instead teaches low-level primitives to analyze the image and extract structural information.

    "post_text": "As humans, we express (either verbally or in writing) our views that carry vast amounts of information and subtle nuances behind them. Every word we speak and paragraph we write has a meaning and contextual reference attached to it. Note that these references depend on factors like situation and time and may differ from one person to another. Computers are great at working with structured data like spreadsheets and database tables. Still, a plethora of information in the world is unstructured — plain, raw text in English or another human dialect. How do we make computers understand humans' language, which does not have a structure, pattern, or guideline to follow? Natural language processing (NLP) is an area of study that teaches computers about understanding the long-term context behind the language we know. We generate more than a petabyte of natural language data per minute; efficient processing is imperative for general intelligence. Everyone has a different requirement when it comes to the value they are seeking from online courses. Perhaps you already have prerequisite knowledge in the domain or you're a novice in the subject. Many online courses cater to audiences having varied interests, from beginner to advanced levels. As a learner, before devoting your time and effort in an online class, you should analyze the course offerings carefully. One course may have good reviews or great projects, but it may not be an excellent fit for you if it does not align with your current knowledge of the subject. To help get started in NLP, here are some things you should look for in online courses. To become an all-round professional in NLP, you should carefully choose the course. A complete course should have attributes like industry-relevant projects, a well-thought-out curriculum and detailed explanations while offering a great pathway to sharpening your knowledge in NLP to help achieve your goals. Become a Natural Language Processing Expert by Udacity is one such course that offers an in-depth understanding of natural language processing and its practical implications on real problems. You have access to industry-grade experts in NLP who teach you how to apply concepts to varied real-world use cases. However, course takers should be aware of the rigor and effort required to complete the program. You have a chance to dive into real-world projects and receive mentor support, and you have the flexibility of time to complete the program. Additionally, you get personalized feedback and other essential services such as resume writing to boost your job opportunities. The only downside is the high cost compared to other alternatives. For someone looking to dive deep into the subject of NLP, advanced courses are a way to go. These types of programs avoid preliminary concepts and focus on complex ideas. Generally speaking, the pedagogy includes a lot of exciting research work built on basic concepts. These courses should be a good fit for people who are looking to go a step further in NLP. If you want to challenge yourself, then the Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing program offered by the University of Oxford will not disappoint you. Moreover, these advanced courses demand a certain level of fundamental theoretical and programming knowledge in NLP to get started. If you are looking for a course that provides maximum value, find a program that covers different concepts and use cases. Only a handful of online courses cover the subject from its advent to the current state of research. If you are willing to gain comprehensive knowledge in NLP, Natural language Processing by the Higher School of Economics should be on top of your list. It covers almost everything you can ask for, from basics to contemporary research. You should not expect an intense explanation of concepts, but rather an overview of them. Sometimes, you need to know different ideas to choose a path of interest in the subject. Some courses emphasize a \"learn by doing\" pedagogy that helps people grasp difficult theoretical concepts. I believe that the more you do, the more you learn. The hands-on courses provide a great sense of liberty to you because they help you to understand the concepts in a more practical sense. They answer broad questions such as, \"Why are we learning this concept?\" You should look for what kind of projects and frameworks the course includes before jumping into it. The NLP course by Fastai is taught in Python with Jupyter Notebooks and uses standard libraries such as NLTK, PyTorch and Fastai. Familiarity with working with data in Python and machine learning concepts (such as training and test sets) is a prerequisite. Experience with PyTorch and neural networks is a bonus. In most cases, the course aspirants are looking for entry-level courses to start their NLP journey. If you are one of them, analyzing the course offerings might not be fruitful due to limited background in the subject. Instead, interacting with professionals who have worked in the NLP domain can help you select the right course. Additionally, you can read reviews from people who have taken the course before. You might get a clue whether it is an excellent first course for you or not. For instance, there are beginner-level courses, such as Introduction to Natural Language Processing in Python, where you can brush up on NLP fundamentals. This course's core components are regular expressions and word tokenization, simple topic identification, and named-entity recognition. The program has a prerequisite of basic python programming. Furthermore, it has more than 50 interactive quizzes to test your learning. During these strange times, it is vital to upskill regularly and take control of your professional destiny. Online courses create a level playing field and present a great advantage to us by providing invaluable resources for learning an up-and-coming technology like NLP.",

Every word we speak and paragraph we write has a meaning and contextual reference attached to it. Note that these references depend on factors like situation and time and may differ from one person to another.</p><p>Computers are great at working with structured data like spreadsheets and database tables. Still, a plethora of information in the world is unstructured &#x2014; plain, raw text in English or another human dialect. How do we make computers understand humans&apos; language, which does not have a structure, pattern, or guideline to follow?</p><p>Natural language processing (NLP) is an area of study that teaches computers about understanding the long-term context behind the language we know. We generate more than a petabyte of natural language data per minute; efficient processing is imperative for general intelligence.</p><p>Everyone has a different requirement when it comes to the value they are seeking from online courses. Perhaps you already have prerequisite knowledge in the domain or you&apos;re a novice in the subject. Many online courses cater to audiences having varied interests, from beginner to advanced levels.</p><p>As a learner, before devoting your time and effort in an online class, you should analyze the course offerings carefully. One course may have good reviews or great projects, but it may not be an excellent fit for you if it does not align with your current knowledge of the subject. To help get started in NLP, here are some things you should look for in online courses.</p><p>To become an all-round professional in NLP, you should carefully choose the course. A complete course should have attributes like industry-relevant projects, a well-thought-out curriculum and detailed explanations while offering a great pathway to sharpening your knowledge in NLP to help achieve your goals.</p><p>Become a Natural Language Processing Expert by Udacity is one such course that offers an in-depth understanding of natural language processing and its practical implications on real problems. You have access to industry-grade experts in NLP who teach you how to apply concepts to varied real-world use cases. However, course takers should be aware of the rigor and effort required to complete the program. You have a chance to dive into real-world projects and receive mentor support, and you have the flexibility of time to complete the program. Additionally, you get personalized feedback and other essential services such as resume writing to boost your job opportunities. The only downside is the high cost compared to other alternatives.</p><p>For someone looking to dive deep into the subject of NLP, advanced courses are a way to go. These types of programs avoid preliminary concepts and focus on complex ideas. Generally speaking, the pedagogy includes a lot of exciting research work built on basic concepts. These courses should be a good fit for people who are looking to go a step further in NLP.</p><p>If you want to challenge yourself, then the Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing program offered by the University of Oxford will not disappoint you. Moreover, these advanced courses demand a certain level of fundamental theoretical and programming knowledge in NLP to get started.</p><p>If you are looking for a course that provides maximum value, find a program that covers different concepts and use cases. Only a handful of online courses cover the subject from its advent to the current state of research. If you are willing to gain comprehensive knowledge in NLP, Natural language Processing by the Higher School of Economics should be on top of your list. It covers almost everything you can ask for, from basics to contemporary research. You should not expect an intense explanation of concepts, but rather an overview of them. Sometimes, you need to know different ideas to choose a path of interest in the subject.</p><p>Some courses emphasize a &quot;learn by doing&quot; pedagogy that helps people grasp difficult theoretical concepts. I believe that the more you do, the more you learn. The hands-on courses provide a great sense of liberty to you because they help you to understand the concepts in a more practical sense. They answer broad questions such as, &quot;Why are we learning this concept?&quot; You should look for what kind of projects and frameworks the course includes before jumping into it. The NLP course by Fastai is taught in Python with Jupyter Notebooks and uses standard libraries such as NLTK, PyTorch and Fastai. Familiarity with working with data in Python and machine learning concepts (such as training and test sets) is a prerequisite. Experience with PyTorch and neural networks is a bonus.</p><p>In most cases, the course aspirants are looking for entry-level courses to start their NLP journey. If you are one of them, analyzing the course offerings might not be fruitful due to limited background in the subject. Instead, interacting with professionals who have worked in the NLP domain can help you select the right course. Additionally, you can read reviews from people who have taken the course before. You might get a clue whether it is an excellent first course for you or not.</p><p>For instance, there are beginner-level courses, such as Introduction to Natural Language Processing in Python, where you can brush up on NLP fundamentals. This course&apos;s core components are regular expressions and word tokenization, simple topic identification, and named-entity recognition. The program has a prerequisite of basic python programming. Furthermore, it has more than 50 interactive quizzes to test your learning.</p><p>During these strange times, it is vital to upskill regularly and take control of your professional destiny. Online courses create a level playing field and present a great advantage to us by providing invaluable resources for learning an up-and-coming technology like NLP.</p>",

    "post_text": "Are you a winner? Do you crave for success and back your skill for it? If yes, then you are ready to participate in the hackathon. An ultimate test of endurance and skill powered with a time constraint, it is a highly exciting environment to build rapid prototypes and present to the world. In the hackathon, the participant, usually in a team of few people or as an individual, has to build a minimum viable product (MVP) and prepare a short presentation explaining it. Within a short period, you have to develop and present. The hackathon showcases your skill and determination behind developing a product. There are a few essential tips while preparing for hackathons that will help you in shaping the product effectively and manage your resources optimally. Here is a list of few excellent tips that help you win the next hackathon Team Unity Mostly all hackathons are team-based. The basic premise is to replicate organizational behavior where peers work in micro-teams to achieve milestones. To win the hackathon, you have to form your dream team. The first thing to do when you get to a hackathon is to develop a team. You will be building a team with random people, and ideally, a 3~5 person team is excellent. Often, you will find that people there are equipped with different expertise. Different skills will complement each other, and the end product will be much more diverse. It would help if you had people that have at least three skillsets as follows A Presenter who can present and communicate the approach and idea behind the product you create during the hackathon. If you are very confident in building a great product, good to hear that. Though you can’t sell it to the audience, I’m sorry to tell you that no matter how great your idea is, you will most likely fail. An End-User Designer who can design a user interface for your product will ultimately sell the idea. A Coder who can build the brains behind your product. Someone who can quickly use existing technologies and platforms to create a working prototype in a given timeframe. The cohesion of the three skillsets is essential for winning the hackathon. Effective Communication After assembling the perfect team, you have to make sure of excellent communication. Continuously, talk amongst yourselves and figure what works and what does not. Brainstorm with your team and try to come up with a list of ideas. Any random idea is fine; write it out and see which one makes the most sense. Knowing each member’s strengths and weaknesses beforehand gives you an advantage in preparation and execution. ‘Getting the right people and the right chemistry is more important than getting the right idea.’ — Ed Catmull, previously CEO of Pixar’ Ask Important Questions Think like a product owner and try to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Focus on the central problem statement: Who is the end-user? What is your hypothesis? What problem are you solving for them? Figure out what companies are looking for. After you have formed your team, calm down, and observe. Look around and make sure you know who are the event sponsors. Consider the time involved in executing the ideas. Pick only those features that you can build in 24-72 hours. With a clear product vision, you can create a rough design of a prototype on paper. Share this with your team so that everyone knows the key components and who is building what. Confirmation of Ideas Don’t jump to conclusions about concepts without researching. Be clear on what you are building and why. Share the dependencies and priorities with the team. Talk to potential end-users or customers of the product. Understand their pain points. Consider these insights in your presentation and validate the concept before prototyping and after building the product. Know your Audience What are the backgrounds of your judges? Are they investors? Are they business development folks? Are they CTOs or do they have an Engineering background? Are they API Evangelists representing their company? Choose your idea and tailor your presentation based on your makeup of the judging panel. Here are the 4 main types that I’ve identified, and the tactics to consider for each. Identifying these unknowns will help to create a solution that is better understood by judges and thereby increasing chances of winning. Perfection is the enemy of progress Don’t try to build a perfect product, instead try to build a minimum viable product that shows promise of being a perfect product. For a given timeframe, a perfect product is almost impossible. A working Proof Of Concept(POC) is that aligns with your idea is the expected deliverable. A POC doesn’t have to be bug-free and it can actually have zero functionality. In fact, most of the time, more than 80% of the functions are hard-coded. It is just for visualization purposes, helping the audience understand how your product/idea works. Although a POC doesn’t have to have all the functions, one important thing is that it must look good . Try to make it look really nice so that the judges can be impressed when they see your team coming up with such a beautifully designed product in a limited amount of time. Design Approach Confirmation One of the biggest takeaways with writing code and building proof of concepts is that never over prioritize the backend. Learn in advance on how to create and plugin a quick backend to a frontend. If there is a relaxation of time, you can go for a API design approach. Though a front-end developer approach is ideal, If you have no front-end developers in your team, you and your team might want to switch strategy and focus solely on design. Adopt Use of Quick Designing Tools Use templates and utilize the color schemes that past designers have already perfected. Copy from the great product developers and fuse your own hack concept. Use resources such as http://tympanus.net/codrops/ , http://pttrns.com , http://mobile-pttrns.com , and http://useronboard.com Use a design prototyping strategy, particularly if your concept is more about a new User Experience rather than backend functionality. Design prototyping strategy provides a great way for creative people who cannot code: Cut and paste together designs from Pttrns.com onto Adobe Illustrator. Combine features and design layouts together. Make 4–5-page layouts. Use Invision.com or Flinto.com to wrap it. Pitch A great pitch can elevate your idea and lead you to win the hackathon. You can’t sell if you don’t speak. You have to speak, explain, and sell the ide in a very limited time. So make sure that you take out some time working on your pitch. The presenter may be the team member that adds the least obvious value, but winning an event like this is all about the pitch. Nobody cares how good the code or product is if you can’t present it well. Our pitch had to be a strict three minutes long. Most teams had a single presenter, but we actually had three team members involved in the pitch. Both options work. Avoid Common Mistakes Not having a Proof-Of-Concept (POC) that could be showcased during the presentation. Simple idea, just put yourself in the judges’ shoes. If you were the judge, would you prefer someone who could show you something, say a website or mobile app, or someone who could only verbally tell you what their idea was? Which one would you think is more convincing? Another mistake that many people make, especially those who first join a hackathon — focussing too much on building a functional or bug-free application . It is undeniable that this is right while building a proper product, but unfortunately, it does not work for the hackathon. Hardcoding is allowed here! And the last one, also the one that I think people neglect — not spending enough time preparing for the presentation. The presentation is the only chance where you can sell your idea to the judges, the only time you can tell them: “my(give) idea(me) is(the) brilliant(prize)!”. So, you should always spend more time preparing for your presentation. After hours of coding, taking a break is a good idea. A short break is not only refreshing but also provides the opportunity to check-in as a team and update each other on the progress of the project. The Global AI Hackathon #BuildwithAI 24th July 2020 The Global AI hackathon (#BuildwithAI) is an opportunity for builders to create AI solutions that drive social impact, with the aim of tackling some of the challenges related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

An ultimate test of endurance and skill powered with a time constraint, it is a highly exciting environment to build rapid prototypes and present to the world.</p><p>In the hackathon, the participant, usually in a team of few people or as an individual, has to build a minimum viable product (MVP) and prepare a short presentation explaining it. Within a short period, you have to develop and present. The hackathon showcases your skill and determination behind developing a product.</p><p>There are a few essential tips while preparing for hackathons that will help you in shaping the product effectively and manage your resources optimally.</p><p>Here is a list of few excellent tips that help you win the next hackathon</p><p><strong>Team Unity</strong></p><p>Mostly all hackathons are team-based. The basic premise is to replicate organizational behavior where peers work in micro-teams to achieve milestones. To win the hackathon, you have to form your dream team. The first thing to do when you get to a hackathon is to develop a team. You will be building a team with random people, and ideally, a 3~5 person team is excellent.</p><p>Often, you will find that people there are equipped with different expertise. Different skills will complement each other, and the end product will be much more diverse. It would help if you had people that have at least three skillsets as follows</p><p><strong>A Presenter </strong>who can present and communicate the approach and idea behind the product you create during the hackathon. If you are very confident in building a great product, good to hear that. Though you can&#x2019;t sell it to the audience, I&#x2019;m sorry to tell you that no matter how great your idea is, you will most likely fail.</p><p><strong>An End-User Designer </strong>who can design a user interface for your product will ultimately sell the idea.</p><p><strong>A Coder </strong>who can build the brains behind your product. Someone who can quickly use existing technologies and platforms to create a working prototype in a given timeframe.</p><p>The cohesion of the three skillsets is essential for winning the hackathon.</p><p><strong>Effective Communication</strong></p><p>After assembling the perfect team, you have to make sure of excellent communication. Continuously, talk amongst yourselves and figure what works and what does not. Brainstorm with your team and try to come up with a list of ideas. Any random idea is fine; write it out and see which one makes the most sense.</p><p>Knowing each member&#x2019;s strengths and weaknesses beforehand gives you an advantage in preparation and execution. &#x2018;Getting the right people and the right chemistry is more important than getting the right idea.&#x2019; &#x2014; Ed Catmull, previously CEO of Pixar&#x2019;</p><p><strong>Ask Important Questions</strong></p><p>Think like a product owner and try to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Focus on the central problem statement: Who is the end-user? What is your hypothesis? What problem are you solving for them? Figure out what companies are looking for. After you have formed your team, calm down, and observe. Look around and make sure you know who are the event sponsors.</p><p>Consider the time involved in executing the ideas. Pick only those features that you can build in 24-72 hours. With a clear product vision, you can create a rough design of a prototype on paper. Share this with your team so that everyone knows the key components and who is building what.</p><p><strong>Confirmation of Ideas</strong></p><p>Don&#x2019;t jump to conclusions about concepts without researching. Be clear on what you are building and why.&#xA0; Share the dependencies and priorities with the team. Talk to potential end-users or customers of the product. Understand their pain points. Consider these insights in your presentation and validate the concept before prototyping and after building the product.</p><p><strong>Know your Audience</strong></p><p>What are the backgrounds of your judges? Are they investors? Are they business development folks? Are they CTOs or do they have an Engineering background? Are they API Evangelists representing their company?</p><p>Choose your idea and tailor your presentation based on your makeup of the judging panel. Here are the 4 main types that I&#x2019;ve identified, and the tactics to consider for each. Identifying these unknowns will help to create a solution that is better understood by judges and thereby increasing chances of winning.</p><p><strong>Perfection is the enemy of progress</strong></p><p>Don&#x2019;t try to build a perfect product, instead try to build a minimum viable product that shows promise of being a perfect product. For a given timeframe, a perfect product is almost impossible. A working Proof Of Concept(POC) is that aligns with your idea is the expected deliverable.</p><p>A POC doesn&#x2019;t have to be bug-free and it can actually have zero functionality. In fact, most of the time, more than 80% of the functions are hard-coded. It is just for visualization purposes, helping the audience understand how your product/idea works.</p><p>Although a POC doesn&#x2019;t have to have all the functions, one important thing is that <strong>it must look good</strong>. Try to make it look really nice so that the judges can be impressed when they see your team coming up with such a beautifully designed product in a limited amount of time.</p><p><strong>Design Approach Confirmation</strong></p><p>One of the biggest takeaways with writing code and building proof of concepts is that never over prioritize the backend. Learn in advance on how to create and plugin a quick backend to a frontend. If there is a relaxation of time, you can go for a API design approach. Though a front-end developer approach is ideal, If you have no front-end developers in your team, you and your team might want to switch strategy and focus solely on design.</p><p><strong>Adopt Use of Quick Designing Tools&#xA0;</strong></p><p>Use templates and utilize the color schemes that past designers have already perfected. Copy from the great product developers and fuse your own hack concept. Use resources such as <a href=\"http://tympanus.net/codrops/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://tympanus.net/codrops/</a>, <a href=\"http://pttrns.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://pttrns.com</a>, <a href=\"http://mobile-pttrns.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://mobile-pttrns.com</a>, and <a href=\"http://useronboard.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">http://useronboard.com</a></p><p>Use a design prototyping strategy, particularly if your concept is more about a new User Experience rather than backend functionality. Design prototyping strategy provides a great way for creative people who cannot code:</p><ol><li>Cut and paste together designs from Pttrns.com onto Adobe Illustrator.</li><li>Combine features and design layouts together.</li><li>Make 4&#x2013;5-page layouts.</li><li>Use<a href=\"http://www.invisionapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"> Invision.com</a> or<a href=\"https://www.flinto.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"> Flinto.com</a> to wrap it.</li></ol><p><strong>Pitch</strong></p><p>A great pitch can elevate your idea and lead you to win the hackathon. You can&#x2019;t sell if you don&#x2019;t speak. You have to speak, explain, and sell the ide in a very limited time. So make sure that you take out some time working on your pitch.</p><p>The presenter may be the team member that adds the least obvious value, but winning an event like this is all about the pitch. Nobody cares how good the code or product is if you can&#x2019;t present it well. Our pitch had to be a strict three minutes long. Most teams had a single presenter, but we actually had three team members involved in the pitch. Both options work.</p><div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"><img alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C5612AQHw_RXv1zoQLA/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1594636878811?e=1740009600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=y9OmvkQZsFs04z3uiafhb-j_m71tjZpx68JhD6OcM7Y\" src=\"//:0\"></div><p><strong>Avoid Common Mistakes&#xA0;</strong></p><p><strong>Not having a Proof-Of-Concept (POC) </strong>that could be showcased during the presentation. Simple idea, just put yourself in the judges&#x2019; shoes. If you were the judge, would you prefer someone who could show you something, say a website or mobile app, or someone who could only verbally tell you what their idea was? Which one would you think is more convincing?</p><p>Another mistake that many people make, especially those who first join a hackathon &#x2014; <strong>focussing too much on building a functional or bug-free application</strong>. It is undeniable that this is right while building a proper product, but unfortunately, it does not work for the hackathon. Hardcoding is allowed here!</p><p>And the last one, also the one that I think people neglect &#x2014; <strong>not spending enough time preparing for the presentation.</strong> The presentation is the only chance where you can sell your idea to the judges, the only time you can tell them: &#x201C;my(give) idea(me) is(the) brilliant(prize)!&#x201D;. So, you should always spend more time preparing for your presentation.</p><p>After hours of coding, taking a break is a good idea. A short break is not only refreshing but also provides the opportunity to check-in as a team and update each other on the progress of the project.</p><iframe class=\"center\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"about:blank\" width=\"744\" title=\"Global AI Hackathon #BuildwithAI 2020: Emergence\" height=\"419\" data-li-src=\"https://www.linkedin.com/embeds/publishingEmbed.html?articleId=7770508222675025694\"></iframe><h2><a href=\"https://hackmakers.com/aihack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">The Global AI Hackathon #BuildwithAI 24th July 2020</a></h2><p>The&#xA0;Global AI hackathon (#BuildwithAI)&#xA0;is an opportunity for builders to create AI solutions that drive social impact, with the aim of tackling some of the challenges related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

    "post_text": "On April 12, We broke Hackathon history by executing the largest online hackathon in APAC to date: with almost 3,000 competitors, mentors and lead mentors- all within only 9 days using a shoestring budget and a total team of four. They did it again a couple of weeks ago, working with the Australian and New Zealand Defence Forces involving over 25 Defence organizations and industry partners. Introduction The motivation for #flattenthecurvehack and #anzdfhack Like many of us, we see politicians, scientists and medical professionals racking their brains on how to solve and address some of the biggest problems the world is facing under this pandemic. However, my team thought: what we can the ordinary citizen do to help create a better society? Can we not tap into the innovation and creativity of thousands of software engineers, designers and business people to push us along? The hackathon – what is it, the main objectives and benefits A hackathon can be described as a “marathon of invention”. Anyone interested in ideating a solution for a specific challenge attends a hackathon to learn, build & share their creations over the course of typically 48-72 hours. How it works In a nutshell, during a hackathon team develop a project from scratch, demo it to judges, and win prizes! Another way to look at it is to compress the software development from development to deployment, in the span of one weekend. Challenges for this Virtual hackathon during COVID-19 period 2,000+ participants from around the world Managing 15 people in your team is difficult. If you’re a CEO, managing 1,000 people might be a challenge. In our case, with 2,700 completely new faces, from 13 different time zones presented its own challenges in the dissemination of information, competing categories, sponsorships, judging and of course the deadline of submissions. Different skills set & background (some are experienced professionals, some are fresh graduates, etc) As countless articles on the web can read: diversity in any team produces more innovative, productive and engaged members, and this is exceptionally true when you have to build a team, ideat and ship a product in two days. We ensured to the best of our ability diversity of skillset through our capture forms, to understand who and why mentors and competitors were participating, and to really understand and optimize the dynamics of team creation, mentor pairing and lead mentor groups. According to Janson Lim, Chief Mentor Organiser ”we explicitly created lead mentor groups with diversity in age and industry, seniority while maintaining a very high level of hackathon experience requirement to encourage mentors to learn from each other, as much as the teams were learning from the mentors themselves.” Most participants do not know each other – teams are formed online (with strangers) The saying “you don’t get a second chance to make a good first impression” holds true in all settings, but it is especially important online. Building and forming a trust is the bedrock of successful team-building and there were many tips and tricks that we employed behind the scenes. Some of the most successful experiments we executed were Creating private channels for teams based on an internal algorithm for ideal team creation Cross-pollinating data from different channels to give meaningful and interesting resources and requests more visibility to other competitors. Innovative use of IT for a virtual hackathon Being a completely virtual hackathon presents its own challenges and perks. Sure, you don’t get the irreplaceable face to face interaction in your team and mentor, and there isn’t free food to eat. But as long as you have rock-solid software, a passionate heart, then you can overcome anything, Most importantly: the event, despite having some incredible technological minds involved, doesn’t need to use complex and feature-rich software.. In many ways; the key fundamentals of effective communication, private rooms to ideate, and access to qualified mentors and resources are key. To this end, we used: Youtube’s free Livestream service to broadcast the opening ceremony and judging awards. Slack as the primary communication channel, with the pro version generously supported by Slack APAC. Simple, cloud-based applications for workplace collaboration (Google forms, Trello) Linkedin, Twitter for marketing and social media activity And Zoom for webinars, mentor inductions, and workshops for our competitors. Lessons learned Both #FlattentheCurve and #ANZDFHack varied in their challenge scope, audience size, and processes. In each case, our team was able to rapidly ideate, deploy and iterate on new resources, induction methods and timelines on the audience: Which yielded amazing results. Lesson #1: For IT: Simple is best. It goes without saying how reliant we are on the basics of IT systems in our day-to-day life, but that is a conversation for a different day. The key lesson we learnt was that as much as hackathon bespoke solutions exist in the market, you don’t need a great deal to execute a high-quality experience: only qualified people in the driver’s seat. Lesson #2: Teams can work it out Participants are not children who need direction and guidance from a parent. Many are smart students, managers and passionate individuals who do not need the top-down pressure to remain motivated to ideate the next best solution. Channeling that energy is all that an organizer needs to do: any more and the experience may start to spoil. Lesson #3: Mentoring is critical In this same vein: Mentors are not micro-managers who need to timebox or patronize their peers. All that true innovation requires for mentors is light-touch deep expertise in challenge areas and a safety net for when cr*p hits the fan. Lesson #4: Under pressure, diamonds can form There is a reason why hackathons are short and provide some of the most effective value to time ratios for any organization to begin the process of innovation. With a perfect mix of global anxiety, restlessness, incredible expertise and passion, this created some of the most amazing products that our organization has seen. From 3D printed helmets to children's education tools, our team was astounded by the level of thought and care put into their works.

    "post_text_html": "<p>On April 12, We broke Hackathon history by executing the largest online hackathon in APAC to date: with almost 3,000 competitors, mentors and lead mentors- all within only 9 days using a shoestring budget and a total team of four. They did it again a couple of weeks ago, working with the Australian and New Zealand Defence Forces involving over 25 Defence organizations and industry partners.</p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p><strong>The motivation for #flattenthecurvehack and #anzdfhack</strong></p><p>Like many of us, we see politicians, scientists and medical professionals racking their brains on how to solve and address some of the biggest problems the world is facing under this pandemic.&#xA0;</p><p>However, my team thought: what we can the ordinary citizen do to help create a better society? Can we not tap into the innovation and creativity of thousands of software engineers, designers and business people to push us along?</p><p><strong>The hackathon &#x2013; what is it, the main objectives and benefits</strong></p><p>A hackathon can be described as a &#x201C;marathon of invention&#x201D;. Anyone interested in ideating a solution for a specific challenge attends a hackathon to learn, build &amp; share their creations over the course of typically 48-72 hours.</p><p><strong>How it works</strong></p><p>In a nutshell, during a hackathon team develop a project from scratch, demo it to judges, and win prizes! Another way to look at it is to compress the software development from development to deployment, in the span of one weekend.</p><p>&#xA0;<strong>Challenges for this Virtual hackathon during COVID-19 period&#xA0;</strong></p><p><strong>2,000+ participants from around the world</strong></p><p>Managing 15 people in your team is difficult. If you&#x2019;re a CEO, managing 1,000 people might be a challenge. In our case, with 2,700 completely new faces, from 13 different time zones presented its own challenges in the dissemination of information, competing categories, sponsorships, judging and of course the deadline of submissions.&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Different skills set &amp; background (some are experienced professionals, some are fresh graduates, etc)</strong></p><p>As countless articles on the web can read: diversity in any team produces more innovative, productive and engaged members, and this is exceptionally true when you have to build a team, ideat and ship a product in two days.</p><p>We ensured to the best of our ability diversity of skillset through our capture forms, to understand who and why mentors and competitors were participating, and to really understand and optimize the dynamics of team creation, mentor pairing and lead mentor groups.</p><p>According to Janson Lim, Chief Mentor Organiser &#x201D;we explicitly created lead mentor groups with diversity in age and industry, seniority while maintaining a very high level of hackathon experience requirement to encourage mentors to learn from each other, as much as the teams were learning from the mentors themselves.&#x201D;</p><div class=\"slate-resizable-image-embed slate-image-embed__resize-full-width\"><img alt=\"No alt text provided for this image\" data-media-urn data-li-src=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C5612AQFbjSsYK1_2yw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1592185554958?e=1740009600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=glJgpO_hwNbjEibD4m9x8F8xz3lqUbPs-TmLg7rretc\" src=\"//:0\"></div><p><br></p><p><strong>Most participants do not know each other &#x2013; teams are formed online (with strangers)</strong></p><p>The saying &#x201C;you don&#x2019;t get a second chance to make a good first impression&#x201D; holds true in all settings, but it is especially important online. Building and forming a trust is the bedrock of successful team-building and there were many tips and tricks that we employed behind the scenes. Some of the most successful experiments we executed were</p><p>Creating private channels for teams based on an internal algorithm for ideal team creation</p><p>Cross-pollinating data from different channels to give meaningful and interesting resources and requests more visibility to other competitors.</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><strong>Innovative use of IT for a virtual hackathon</strong></p><p>Being a completely virtual hackathon presents its own challenges and perks. Sure, you don&#x2019;t get the irreplaceable face to face interaction in your team and mentor, and there isn&#x2019;t free food to eat. But as long as you have rock-solid software, a passionate heart, then you can overcome anything, Most importantly: the event, despite having some incredible technological minds involved, doesn&#x2019;t need to use complex and feature-rich software.. In many ways; the key fundamentals of effective communication, private rooms to ideate, and access to qualified mentors and resources are key. To this end, we used:</p><ol><li>Youtube&#x2019;s free Livestream service to broadcast the opening ceremony and judging awards.</li><li>Slack as the primary communication channel, with the pro version generously supported by Slack APAC.</li><li>Simple, cloud-based applications for workplace collaboration (Google forms, Trello)</li><li>Linkedin, Twitter for marketing and social media activity</li><li>And Zoom for webinars, mentor inductions, and workshops for our competitors.</li></ol><p><strong>Lessons learned</strong></p><p>Both #FlattentheCurve and #ANZDFHack varied in their challenge scope, audience size, and processes. In each case, our team was able to rapidly ideate, deploy and iterate on new resources, induction methods and timelines on the audience: Which yielded amazing results.</p><p>Lesson #1: For IT: Simple is best.</p><p>It goes without saying how reliant we are on the basics of IT systems in our day-to-day life, but that is a conversation for a different day. The key lesson we learnt was that as much as hackathon bespoke solutions exist in the market, you don&#x2019;t need a great deal to execute a high-quality experience: only qualified people in the driver&#x2019;s seat.</p><p>Lesson #2: Teams can work it out</p><p>Participants are not children who need direction and guidance from a parent. Many are smart students, managers and passionate individuals who do not need the top-down pressure to remain motivated to ideate the next best solution. Channeling that energy is all that an organizer needs to do: any more and the experience may start to spoil.</p><p>Lesson #3: Mentoring is critical</p><p>In this same vein: Mentors are not micro-managers who need to timebox or patronize their peers. All that true innovation requires for mentors is light-touch deep expertise in challenge areas and a safety net for when cr*p hits the fan.</p><p>Lesson #4: Under pressure, diamonds can form</p><p>There is a reason why hackathons are short and provide some of the most effective value to time ratios for any organization to begin the process of innovation. With a perfect mix of global anxiety, restlessness, incredible expertise and passion, this created some of the most amazing products that our organization has seen. From 3D printed helmets to children&apos;s education tools, our team was astounded by the level of thought and care put into their works.</p><iframe class=\"center\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"about:blank\" height=\"419\" width=\"744\" title=\"Global AI Hackathon #BuildwithAI 2020: Emergence\" data-li-src=\"https://www.linkedin.com/embeds/publishingEmbed.html?articleId=7770508222675025694\"></iframe><p><br></p><h2><a href=\"https://hackmakers.com/aihack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><strong>The Global AI Hackathon #BuildwithAI 24th July 2020 </strong></a></h2><p>The&#xA0;Global AI Hackathon (#BuildwithAI)&#xA0;is an opportunity for builders to create AI solutions that drive social impact, with the aim of tackling some of the challenges related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
